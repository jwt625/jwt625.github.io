Hi there, this is Wentao. Here's the fun version of my bio:
- I grew up in [Deyang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deyang), a small town about 1 h north [Chengdu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chengdu), the capital city of Sichuan.
- I spent six years in Chengdu for middle and high school. I had a lot of fun picking locks, stealing chemicals from school labs, did [thermite reaction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N50IjDB5Sk&ab_channel=RMSCVideo) under our dining hall stairs, almost intoxicated one friend with aqua regia, and attempted making nitroglycerin (These are what would happen if you lock kids up for too long in a boarding school). I got into math in high school and did not do as much real-world fun stuff.
- I got tortured by physics for four years at Tsinghua University in Beijing.


I dump my random thoughts and projects here. I try to have better writing than the notes I take during the projects.

For detail project notes, see my [Obsidian journals](https://github.com/jwt625/Obsidian-Journals). Feel free to clone and open in Obsidian for better visual. These journals are chaotic and might include explicit languages, comsume them at your own risk!

I keep the code written for these projects in my [Playground](https://github.com/jwt625/PlayGround). If one reaches a point worth its own repo, I will spin it off.
