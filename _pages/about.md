Hi there, this is Wentao. Here's the fun version of my bio (maybe I should link a CV here for a serious version):
- I grew up in [Deyang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deyang), a small town about 1 h north of [Chengdu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chengdu), the capital city of Sichuan (place of spicy food and where everyone rides a panda to school).
- I spent six years in Chengdu for middle and high school. I had a lot of fun picking locks, stealing chemicals from school labs, did [thermite reaction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N50IjDB5Sk&ab_channel=RMSCVideo) under our dining hall stairs, almost intoxicated one friend with aqua regia, and attempted making nitroglycerin (These are what would happen if you lock kids up for too long in a boarding school). I got into math in high school and did not do as much real-world fun stuff.
- I got tortured by physics for four years at Tsinghua University in Beijing, where I also started getting into quantum computing and nanofabrication since mid 2015. (I should write up stuff I did during this time.)
- I did my PhD in applied physics at Stanford from 2017 to 2022 at Ginzton lab and [LINQS](https://linqs.stanford.edu/), and has been in the bay area since 2017. My main PhD project involves tiny (1/100th of human hair size) devices that make light and sound run into each other as much as possible. I design, make, and characterize these devices, which got me exposed to RF/microwave, telecom optics/photonics, cryogenics, and plenty of nanofab. (I should also write up these stuff more and better.)
- I'm now into electronics (digital please save me from analog) and robotics more. Shits are getting so cheap everyone should play with them!
- Am I also supposed to talk about work stuff? Maybe I will add more later.

I plan to dump my random thoughts and projects here. I will try to have better writing than the notes I take during the projects.

For detail project notes, see my [Obsidian journals](https://github.com/jwt625/Obsidian-Journals). Feel free to clone and open in Obsidian for better visual. These journals are chaotic and might include explicit languages, comsume them at your own risk!

I keep the code written for these projects in my [Playground](https://github.com/jwt625/PlayGround). If one reaches a point worth its own repo, I will spin it off.
