# Surface piezoelectricity in superconducting qubits

Daily reminder of “God made solids, but surfaces are the work of the devil”. While it could be put to good use like SHG microscopy for domain boundaries, more often it messes with you like piezoelectricity on the surface of perfectly crystalline silicon, and make your qubit lossy

# Wireless brain-computer interface with 65,536 electrodes

thats a lot of stuff on a single 12x12 mm^2 CMOS chip, including 256 × 256 array of electrodes, controller, and wireless power and transceiver. Only 50 um total thickness so the chip is flexible enough to survive curvature of the brain. they tested it for up to 2 months in monkey brain. I wonder how long would it take for the chip to be destroyed by the brain.

# 100 kA explosive pyro-breaker for fusion magnets

100 kA/10 kV breaker that fractures the contact using explosive. The explosive is surrounded by DI water inside the cylindrical contact, so that when the contact got blasted into segments, arcs between them would get extinguished immediately.

   - it's developed for quenching the superconducting magnets in the Comprehensive Research Facility for Fusion Technology (CRAFT) project. ITER also has a 70 kA pyro-breaker.
