5. gf: what's the thing you got on your screen, three little pink heart? aww it's so cute!
me: uh, it's complicated, but yes it's cute!
(trying to get the RCS of a resonant subwavelength size (~lambda/50) antenna)

   - If you are doing scattered field + frequency sweep, remember to update the background field accordingly (since the frequency is changing)... Spent two nights debugging this.
Otherwise part of the background field will appear as scattered field and also appear in the far field

   - Actually looks pretty menacing on-resonance lol
(capped the color range at 10x of the background field. The antenna is 1.5 mm, comparing to the em wavelength~87 mm at 3.35 GHz. RCS is almost 1e6x of off-resonance RCS, enhanced by ~Q^2.
Q~800, very close to Chu–Harrington limit)
   ![20241129_082928_0.jpg](/assets/images/2024/20240429_20241204/20241129_082928_0.jpg)

6. Have you wondered why atoms "look like" they have size of ~1 um under laser illumination?

One reason: you could only resolve things at ~wavelength of the light. However, this 0.2 nm size strontium atom could also be captured with not so crazy optics (50 mm lens) & exposure time, which means it has very high scattering cross section to "reflect" the blue-violet light illumination. It also appears huge because of the smaller NA of the camera (separation of the two ion trap metal tip is 2 mm).

Turns out the scattering cross section of an atom on-resonance is comparable to the wavelength if you go thru the physics and math (3λ^2/3pi), and you can observe very similar wavelength-scale radar cross section on a tiny subwavelength rf/microwave antenna as well, fully passive.

Here I looked at a ~1.5 mm dipole antenna, resonant at 3.46 GHz, i.e., its size is ~1/60 wavelength, and its on-resonance RCS is almost x1e6 of off-resonance RCS).

Similar to Chu–Harrington limit of antenna Q, this is a very general rule for any passive scatterer of size within a sphere of radius a << λ: its max RCS is ~λ^2, independent of its size. You could have a very high-Q atom scattering light as if it is as big as ~1 um, and you could build a tiny passive rf antenna that "looks huge" on-resonance (it has to be low internal loss).

   - Also good to clarify about "resolution", if you know what you are looking for and have very high SNR measurement, you could always resolve e.g. two gaussians with separation much smaller than their widths.

8. I've been shilling and long term bullish in comsol. They have been constantly updating and expanding the multiphysics, tutorials, application library and material library etc etc, and each update has meaningful capability & user experience improvement.

Take the mesh on periodic boundary condition (PBC) surfaces as an example for the user experience: 
- In 5.0 - 5.4 you need to manually mesh one surface and copy to another surface to make sure the mesh is identical on the pairs of surfaces (so that the PBC would work properly).
- Since 5.6 or so, the automatically generated mesh starts to take care of this, and when you've run it once and then switch to manual, you'll see the auto-added surface mesh + copy.
- Since 6.2 iirc, now you could have an "identical mesh" constraint on the pair of surfaces, and mesh them at any order you like, more flexible than meshing them separately first.
- I could personally come up a few more examples like this.

It still sucks every now and then, and there are things that need a lot of manual/scripted setup or impossible. But the list for these things has been shrinking, and there is a growing list of stuff that used to take a phd journey to figure out and setup properly, but now is just one of the physics or multiphysics settings.

10. TIL Toshiba researchers have made a entangled photon pair source by putting a quantum dot in an LED-like semiconductor structure, as early as 2010. They inject two pairs of electrons-holes into the quantum dot, and they'd recombine and emit polarization entangled photons.

I'm surprised I have not seen it earlier and more often, maybe it is because the wavelength is too short (400 nm)?
Then I saw they have made it into the telecom O-band (~1300 nm) in 2014. Ok maybe the rate and fidelity are low?
Then I saw they made them upto 33 kHz and 94% in 2020. My last guess would be yield... and voila, "typical yield of around 0.9%"

   - A quantum dot is a very common type of single-photon emitter. When you confine electrons along all three dimensions (like an atom does), you get a "dot", and you'll get discrete and nonlinear energy levels for the electrons, and one those transitions would emit a single photon. (see this nice review from Senellart2017: [High-performance semiconductor quantum-dot single-photon sources](https://tsapps.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=923145))

11. Nature briefing did a poll last week on ScienceTwitter vs ScienceSky.
Results aside, I find it interesting that a total of ~ 6000 people responded. I digged out a few more polls done by them in a similar way, and they all have similar total votes of 4000 ~ 8000.

So roughly 60k to 600k people are subscribed to nature briefing? (assuming engagement rate of 1%~10%)
