# Introduction

The internet has become an essential tool for people to communicate, for both work and entertainment. Since the first internet service providers in 1989, the population of internet users around the world has reached 2.5 billion in 2013. [1] Along with the growth of the internet, the amount of energy comsumed by information communication technology (ICT) is also drastically increasing. From 2007 to 2012, the worldwide electricity consumption has increased by 10.1% on annual average, from 219 TWh to 354 TWh. In the same time period, the share of energy consumption for communication networks in total electricity consumption has grown from 1.3% to 1.8%. [2]

Given the limited natural resources we have and the fact that the advance in ICT results in a positive impact on electricity consumption, it is necessary to exam and reduce the energy we spend on transmitting one bit of information. [3] I will consider two simple case, the energy required to transmit one bit using electrical cables and the energy required to transmit one bit, with optical fibers.
