# Achromatic Polymer Diffractive Lenses for Astrophotography
100 mm diameter, 2.4  μm thick multilevel diffractive lens (MDL), focal length 200 mm, optimized for the visible wavelength range, achieving achromatic focusing with inverse design and grayscale lithography.
They have a company called Oblate Optics, found I've checked out their website but I don't remember when or why..

# Nonlinear Neuromorphic Computing via Linear Wave Scattering
Fully nonlinear neuromorphic computing with linear wave scattering: you can encode your input in the parameters of a "linear" system, like detunings and couplings of optical resonators, and achieve arbitrary nonlinear function or process.

# DNA Origami Nanostructures for Viral Trapping and Nanoscale Motors
Found a new rabbit hole called DNA origami, and these are some of the fanciest stuff I've seen in a while: A mouse trap but for virus? A sub 100 nm turbine that could dock into a nanopore? A DNA rotary ratchet motor driven by an AC voltage up to 250 rpm??

Not sure how practical they are, but at least now I feel less humiliated by the E. Coli flagella motor.

# Historical Openness in Bell Labs' Electro-Optomechanical Systems
Reading old journals make me feel sad every now and then. Openess of fields have shifted so much. You could read Bell labs folks sharing the "state-of-the-art" electro-opto-mechanical storage system at the time (flying-spot store) with so much details about every single components.

Now we have similar levels of openess from fields of software and AI etc., but so much less or less systematically from companies doing more physical things.

# Hydrodynamic Wake Discrimination by Seal Whisker
TIL harbor seals could distinguish different shapes just from the object's hydrodynamic wakes (poor dude was blindfolded and claimed to be "familiar with psychophysical experiments and experienced in hydrodynamic trail detection").

Their whiskers are also wavy instead of a simple cylinder to improve sensitivity and durability. How could you not believe in reinforcement learning?

# Diamond Mirrors for High-Power Laser Applications
I received a request for high power mirrors, here is a nice one made of diamond that does not look like a mirror at a glance, but could handle a 10 kW beam within a sub 1 mm diameter spot at 1070 nm

   - The main motivation for this is to avoid "imperfections and defects in, or interfaces between, thin films form sites where laser energy can be absorbed".
   - They tested a typical dielectric mirror with 99.5% reflectivity and it got damaged.

# Event Camera Static Scene Recovery via Noise Correlation
A nice example of "noise" actually being "signal": event cameras only detects changes and thus people thought they cannot tell light intensity of a static scene without change in hardware. Turns out you get noisy event more frequent at low brightness, and you could use this correlation to infer the static scene.

Can you think of other examples of noise being signal? I have two more (kind of).

# Kilometer-Scale Atom Interferometry for Dark Matter Detection
Detecting dark matter and gravitational waves with AI, where AI = Atom Interferometry.

It's similar to optical interferometry, but "splitting and recombining clouds of cold atoms rather than beams of light". There are 10 m ones running, O(100) m ones under construction, and people are cooking up km-scale ones (as big as LIGO) using old mines and rail tunnels.

# EUV Lithography Optics: Sub-Nanometer Surface Precision
I'm pretty sure everyone here knows about starlink. How about starlith: the series of optics for DUV and EUV.

They have some of the most sci-fi specs, such as for EUV: <50 pm rms deviation on 450 mm aspheric EUV mirrors (equivalent to 0.5 mm across the width of the US), and sub nrad pointing accuracy (equivalent to pointing at the moon surface, which is 239 thousand miles away, with less than 20 cm accuracy).

# Scalable Metasurface Fabrication for Imaging and Sensing
Here is a new review article on optical metasurface, and it actually focused on scalable fabrication/manufacturing, and applications including display, imaging/computer vision, biosensing, depth sensing, and energy/thermal.

I really like they showed the roll-to-roll (R2R) nanoimprint fabrication steps, and there are so many examples in different applications, a few open access ones included.
