# Bell Labs thermo-optic phase shifter chips

bell labs still make beautiful chips! or do they? ( chip fabricated by Advanced Micro Foundry (AMF) in Singapore )

   - funny they are not using US fabs like AIM photonics, maybe they don't have this kind of released thermo-optic phase shifters yet Idjadi2025: [Chip-scale modulation-free laser stabilization using vacuum-gap micro-Fabry-P ́erot cavity]( https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21565)

# Josephson traveling-wave parametric amplifier

here is another one but it's a traveling-wave parametric amplifier around 4-12 GHz

   - what a beautiful gain curve. second reaction is how did they measure such broad band, where didthey get the circulator for it, turns out it is with directional couplers.

   - one thing i did not realize until i saw the author's post on linkedin was that the orientation of the JJs had to be fixed for the shadow evap to work.. ( https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7389320386313859074/)

what do you mean the number of parameters per material is 1e7? huh??

   - i guess the way you fit them also matters, if it generalize well you get a decent surrogate model..

# SNS thermal shield visual inspection

i have so many mixed feelings seeing a conference paper figure of a screenshot of a video player playing a meeting recording of a live visual inspection of the thermal shield of the Proton Power Upgrade to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Spallation Neutron Source

# Programmable phononic integrated circuits

this was kind of our vision when we did GHz phononic circuits on TFLN on sapphire, and now many more of these components are realized by this USTC group. although the analogy is nice, phonons / mechanical modes behave quite differently from optical modes, and there are good reasons that the mechanical devices on chips around you do not look like this at all.
![20251101_033905_0.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20250115_20251102/20251101_033905_0.jpg)
   - look at these components, just like the photonic versions. Kudos to them for **measuring** the acoustic amplitude distribution. Xu2025: [Large-scale programmable phononic integrated circuits]( https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26596)
   ![20251101_034422_0.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20250115_20251102/20251101_034422_0.jpg)
   ![20251101_034422_1.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20250115_20251102/20251101_034422_1.jpg)
   ![20251101_034422_2.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20250115_20251102/20251101_034422_2.jpg)
   - one unfortunate difference is that, the propagation loss of these guided GHz acoustic waves at room temperature is ~2 dB/mm, that's ~10x worse than silicon photonics waveguides, and ~100x worse than SiN photonics waveguides. loss per wavelength is a better metrics, and GHz mechanical waves actually have similar wavelengths as telecom wavelength photons, so it's fine to compare per length propagation loss.
   - what's worse is, the expectation on relative bandwidth for a device is much higher for RF and microwave, and much lower for photonics. If you have a grating coupler with ~50 nm bandwidth around 1.55 um, that's more than telecom C band albeit less than 5% of fractional bw. Meanwhile, if your RF circuits only work within 10% bw, that's pretty much a filter already.
   - we did racetrack resonators so there's directional couplers involved

# Ultrasound-driven artificial microbubble muscles

# Chiplet packaging dimensionality marketing

the hell is 4D and 4.5D package? it is fractal?? evolving in time??? Dimensionality is now also a marketing term and no longer means anything.

   - hard to convey complex progress in very few words and without fancy new concepts and jargons. i could also see marketing folks treating this as opportunity to "promote" any simple technical specs to marketing terms..

Ongoing:
- Playground:
   - week 71: Continued [DocEater](https://github.com/jwt625/DocEater)
      - ran lint and type checks, tested all APIs.
   - week 65: Added more analysis to [bay bridge traffic](https://github.com/jwt625/bay-bridge-traffic-cam)
      - should really continue one-click-paper-page!
   - week 63:
      - Continuing [one click web paper](https://github.com/jwt625/PlayGround/tree/main/20250831_one_click_paper_page). Got actual deployment working. Had to refactor backend etc.
      - Also added traffic speed to [Bay Bridge traffic](https://bay-bridge-traffic.com). The repo was spun off from PlayGround last weekend iirc.
      ![BBT-speed](/assets/images/2025/BBT-speed.png)

      - https://bay-bridge-traffic.com
      - I think it is already getting hit hard and slowing down the detection, might have to take this down
      - nope not really getting hit hard, not sure what it was, added some rate limiting and restarted things, now back to 30 fps most of the time
   - week 58: Bay bridge traffic tracker
