1. I was thinking about if we could fill the magnetron cavities with silicon to shrink it by ~3x, and found out rapid microwave annealing:
It turns amorphous silicon into crystalline, and activates the dopants... Why did I suffer thru the trainings to get rapid thermal annealing...

   - Since it's a bit relevant, here is a demonstration showing you could also drill concrete and rock with microwave and millimeter wave
(I remember the book mentioned in the quoted tweet is about drilling on other planets. Let's see if I could find it..)

2. There's a small company doing "near field" ALD/ALE with a probe, it's called direct-write ALD, and the company is ATLANT3D Nanosystems. They gave a talk at Stanford: [Unique Direct Processing Platform Technology ÂµDALP](https://nanolabs.stanford.edu/events/unique-direct-processing-platform-technology-mdalp)

3. This pressure measurement film is from fujifilm called Prescale, and introduced in 1977. The product line includes 9 types for different pressure range from kPa to almost GPa, each with ~ 6 dB range and 10% accuracy. The color is from breaking microcapsules.

4. You've probably seen the array of pyramids in an anechoic chamber. You could make a "pyramid" of Hilbert curve so that it is 3D print friendly and still polarization insensitive. They used carbon-loaded HIPS and achieved lower than -20 dB reflectance over a wide frequency range.

5. Here is what you need to generate ~gigawatt (300 kV * 1 kA) pulsed microwave: a Marx generator (charging capacitors in parallel and discharge in series) submerged in a big oil tank, to discharge into a magnetron as well as a big Helmholtz coil pair.

   - Also learnt there are two major ways of coupling out the microwave power, from the side (radial output = MRO) and from the center (diffraction output = MDO). MRO has large leakage current that does not produce microwave and has lower efficiency (~ 15% vs. ~50% for MDO).

6. Unexpected "alignment chart" for extreme computing.
I won't ask for too much, I'd be happy with the ultimate hot plasma laptop.

   - When you are worried about space debris, the physicists are worried about too many satellites could collapse into a blackhole.

7. First laser metal 3D printing aboard the ISS. It arrived on board January 2024 and installed in May. It prints ~ 4 h a day and finished total of over 200 layers by August for the first print.

10. You might have heard about or used periodic poling if you work in nonlinear optics. For some applications such as THz generation with optical rectification, the poling period is comparable to wafer thickness, and you can just stack wafers, and also get a big aperture as a bonus.

11. The video is so well made, I wish I had it to watch years ago when I was suffering during an experiment class reproducing one
Interference and phase conjugating are so fun and useful in many ways, like determining the shape of a mirror you need, or wavefront/dispersion correction

13. 3D Printing of Nanoscale Photonic Structures.
Two-photon and two-step polymerization are able to achieve much smaller structures than I thought, and one way to do it is to heat-shrink after the print, and get different structured color with different temperatures.

   - They mentioned the NA and bandwidth limit of a single layer metalens. It reminded me of a David Miller paper: [Why optics needs thickness](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade3395), see also on [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03552). Basically if you are manipulating a lot of modes, they need space to exist and propagate.

   - The car uses spray paint color from nanostructures (like some butterflies) instead of pigments, so it does not fade

14. TIL there is a light guide that connects the edge of a scintillator (a thin sheet of phosphor or plastic that fluoresces when struck) in a particle detector to the photodetector/multiplier.
It is made of funky shaped plexiglass, and can be very low loss when properly designed.
