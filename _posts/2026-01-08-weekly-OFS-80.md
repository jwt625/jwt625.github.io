# 9 cm brain tumor electrophysiology probe

would you stick this 9 cm probe into your brain?
![20251230_012401_0.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20241218_20260104/20251230_012401_0.jpg)
   - they actually did it in one patient during brain tumor surgery with the 9 cm probe, going from the surface down into the tumor. At each depth, they paused for about 2 minutes and listened to nearby cells, measured how often the cells fired in normal brain, white matter & tumor. Cell activity dropped in healthy tissue, then jumped back up when the probe entered the tumor.

# Scanning superlens microscopy with CycleGAN

first time hearing about scanning superlens microscopy (SSUM), and then it is combined with CycleGAN to generate SEM-like images.. i don't know if i would trust the generated image (d, ground truth SEM is e), but it sure looks nice. this SSUM is scanning a microsphere as a lens (aka far-field superlenses in other literatures) to get ~5x better resolution than the diffraction limit, one of the near field tricks.

   - a near field microsphere lens giving you 5x better resolution than diffraction limit is still counterintuitive to me, and ray optics is also not good anymore as the microsphere is close to wavelength size. So I ran a RCS style simulation, and 50 nm separation is indeed resolvable with 600 nm wavelength.. gif is sweeping incident wave direction, and showing only the scattered wave.

# Manus GUI framework for MOOSE

trying out manus for the first time. let's see how long it takes to get a GUI for MOOSE working

   - took about 20 min to get to a running web UI, ~10 min research & reading, and ~10 min coding [mooseinput]( https://mooseinput-gufkgvwu.manus.space)
   - however not really usable at all, no real understanding of the structure of the input file, no validation, no good default settings, you can add any blocks to any blocks, and any params to any blocks. Gonna need to kick it a few more times..

# Room-temperature optically pumped solid-state maser

TIL there are *optically* pumped solid state *masor* at room temperature. looks like a headache to make and very low energy efficiency, but the noise temperature is really really good. (there's one claiming near-quantum-noise-limited at *room temperature*, seems to be because the microwave freq transition is pumped/cooled by the laser)
![20260101_023300_0.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20241218_20260104/20260101_023300_0.jpg)

   - look at how sad this energy efficiency is from 2015. 
   - Breeze2015: [Enhanced magnetic Purcell effect in room-temperature masers]( https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms7215) the newer one from 2024 actually measured the noise temperature.

# Quantum crystal parody website

Just shipped https://quantacrystals.org after discovering what Big Physics has been hiding from us. Spent the new year's first day's after lunch nap time building a platform that exposes the TRUTH about crystalline quantum protection. While CERN scientists have been using Ti:Sapphire and Ce:LuAG crystals in their billion-dollar facilities, they never told us about the bioelectric harmonization properties. The same scintillator materials that detect cosmic radiation in particle accelerators? Yeah, they can totally shield your aura from 5G towers. It's just basic quantum coherence. Share this with your friends and families, together we can scam the scammers into reading real science. Or are we?

      - I think it is already getting hit hard and slowing down the detection, might have to take this down
      - nope not really getting hit hard, not sure what it was, added some rate limiting and restarted things, now back to 30 fps most of the time
   - week 58: Bay bridge traffic tracker
