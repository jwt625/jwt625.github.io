# Augmented Reality for Welding

https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1240734. I also remember seeing an old youtube video about headset assisted welding, trying to find it rn...
   - Hell yeah I found it: [High Dynamic Range (HDR) Video Image Processing For Digital Glass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygcm0AQXX9k&ab_channel=Leonardolo). Originally learnt about these in this IEEE article [Steve Mann: My “Augmediated” Life](https://spectrum.ieee.org/steve-mann-my-augmediated-life).
   - Cool as hell

# Acousto-optic Lens for Atom Shuttling

what kind of maniac came up with this sorcery, chirping the acoustic wavelength in an AOD to introduce a cylindrical lensing effect
![20251013_155443_0.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20240304_20251019/20251013_155443_0.jpg)

   - the stuff novel to you is always well-known to a small group of people more than 20 years ago. they used two AOD with chirped acoustic wave launching poopsite phase and direction of propagation, so lateral sweep cancels and focal sweep adds, and could scan at 400 kHz. Kaplan2001: [Acousto-optic lens with very fast focus scanning]( https://doi.org/10.1364/OL.26.001078)

   - these multiphoton laser scanning microscopy people used it to scan a focal spot within a ~(100 um)^3 volume with ~30 us every spot. Reddy2005: [Fast three-dimensional laser scanning scheme using acousto-optic deflectors]( https://doi.org/10.1117/1.2141504)

   <!-- - yes very similar, i remember you shared this to me once before, amazing stuff -->
   <!-- - optical power spectrum? 40 dB is already impressive -->
   <!-- - an AOD deflect light based on the grating pattern from the acoustic wave at around the order of 100 MHz, so it could steer the direction of light with different rf frequencies. If you chirp the frequency you get different pitch and thus deflection angle at different location, and that is a lens. -->
   <!-- - cool idea as well and more control bw -->

   <!-- - yes it is. i think so, you can find 3d printed stuff, you could also do a phased array and then do whatever with dsp. here the signal is so weak so each pixel is antenna + bolometer + TES -->

# Ultra-thick Photoresist Processing

jesus christ freaking 170 um thick photoresist, can you guess the exposure dose?

   - thickest ive done was SPR 220-7, also so thicc like tar, and took a lot of trials to not make it bubble after exposure
   <!-- - this is dose for the photolitho exposure, "healthy" stuff -->
   <!-- - wdym -->
   <!-- - they spun it, with a lot of care to not have bubbles -->

# Heat-shrinkable Circuit Fabrication

so many ways to make circuits the only limit is your imagination. Now imagine cutting and heat shrink it. ( microfluidics folks did it 10+ years ago and could do >10x shrinking )

Ongoing:
- Playground:
   - week 65: Added more analysis to [bay bridge traffic](https://github.com/jwt625/bay-bridge-traffic-cam)
      - should really continue one-click-paper-page!
   - week 63:
      - Continuing [one click web paper](https://github.com/jwt625/PlayGround/tree/main/20250831_one_click_paper_page). Got actual deployment working. Had to refactor backend etc.
      - Also added traffic speed to [Bay Bridge traffic](https://bay-bridge-traffic.com). The repo was spun off from PlayGround last weekend iirc.
      ![BBT-speed](/assets/images/2025/BBT-speed.png)
   - week 62: [one click web paper](https://github.com/jwt625/PlayGround/tree/main/20250831_one_click_paper_page)

      - https://bay-bridge-traffic.com
      - I think it is already getting hit hard and slowing down the detection, might have to take this down
      - nope not really getting hit hard, not sure what it was, added some rate limiting and restarted things, now back to 30 fps most of the time
   - week 58: Bay bridge traffic tracker
