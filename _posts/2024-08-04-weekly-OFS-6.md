1. (Old) You could adapt a Dremel into a centrifuge
- Thingiverse: [DremelFuge - A One-Piece Centrifuge for Rotary Tools](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1483)

2. Trust your gut feeling, it is scientifically proven more effective than concious forecast (for future stock performance) 
- PNAS paper: [Brain activity of professional investors signals future stock performance](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2307982121)
- WSJ: [What Our Brains Know About Stocks—but Won’t Tell Us](https://www.wsj.com/finance/investing/what-our-brains-know-about-stocksbut-wont-tell-us-880d5d72)

3. The list of thin-film lithium niobate foundries keeps growing...
- From [Quantum Computing Inc. - Thin film lithium niobate foundry](https://quantumcomputinginc.com/technology/thin-film-lithium-niobate-foundry)
- The company itself is old. The Stevens Institute of Technology people are likely behind the LN stuff. One of their previous work that kinda "scopped" Hong Tang's [work](https://opg.optica.org/optica/fulltext.cfm?uri=optica-6-12-1455&id=423402): [Ultra-efficient frequency conversion in quasi-phase-matched lithium niobate microrings](https://opg.optica.org/optica/fulltext.cfm?uri=optica-6-9-1244&id=420689)

4. "As the most-read industry report, Volta Foundations Battery Report summarizes the most significant developments in the battery industry. Crowd-sourced from top industry and academia experts, this report seeks to provide a comprehensive and accessible overview of the latest battery research, policy and business landscape."
- [Battery Report (2023)](https://volta.foundation/battery-report)

5. Some 2D materials have refractive index at 1 um as high as 4.5 while having "low loss", pretty insane. Silicon is 3.45 and barly still works at 1 um.
- Nature Photonics paper [Combining ultrahigh index with exceptional nonlinearity in resonant transition metal dichalcogenide nanodisks](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41566-024-01444-9)

6. Meta released SAM2
- Blog: [Introducing SAM 2: The next generation of Meta Segment Anything Model for videos and images](https://ai.meta.com/blog/segment-anything-2/)
- [github](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything-2)
- [Dingboard](https://dingboard.com/) is built off SAM1. Yacine's [tweet](https://x.com/yacineMTB/status/1818285294728470897).

7. Humans can detect a single photo and sense roughness on the order of 10 nm.
- Nature comm paper: [Direct detection of a single photon by human](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms12172)
- Scientific Report paper: [Feeling Small: Exploring the Tactile Perception Limits](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep02617)

8. [https://www.thefisheyelist.com/](https://www.thefisheyelist.com/) has a great collection of different fisheye lense cameras.
- [AEG 17mm f/6.3](https://www.thefisheyelist.com/lens/aeg-17mm-fisheye/)
- Another great lens design resource: [A file exchange site for lens designs](https://www.lens-designs.com/)

9. Most drone parts are made in China

10. Great paper on what it takes to change refractive index from Jacob B Khurgin:
- [Energy and Power requirements for alteration of the refractive index](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16011)
- He has another great paper on why refractive index it is what it is: [Expanding photonic palette: exploring high index materials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01205)
