# Insect Resistance and Plant Health
"The grasshoppers, they are the toughest I have found. The grasshoppers will take a bite out of your plant even if it's a 12. By the time you get to 12 Brix, they lose interest in the plant. The plant is too healthy, it's too difficult to chew, it's too difficult to eat, it's indigestible."

# Advances in Super-Resolution Microscopy

I know you could "cheat" diffraction limit with all sorts of nonlinearities, but holy there has been a lot of development in super-resolution microscopy in the last few years that is beyond my comprehension..

Now what the hell is expansion microscopy, SMLM, RESI? Sub nm resolution??

Stimulated emission depletion (STED) is easy to understand, which uses "a doughnut-shaped depletion beam" to quench the fluorescence emission, and gets you ~10x higher spatial resolution.

I have heard and might have read about MINFLUX, but forgot what it is.

Some of these tricks must be related to "if you know the distribution (PSF) and measure enough samples, you could estimate the centers of two of them with arbitrary separation". Turns out single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) is basically doing this.
![20250309_020713_0.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20250108_20250318/20250309_020713_0.jpg)

   - Expansion microscopy is actually literally expanding the specimen, "by synthesizing a swellable polymer network within a specimen"...
   - It could expand almost 10x, and isotropic within 1%, damn.

   - Resolution enhancement by sequential imaging (RESI) sounds like an extension of SMLM, it also uses "dye-labelled ‘imager’ strands" attached to "complementary ‘docking’ strands on target molecules of interest", but further separate the target into subsets, and bind & image them

   - LOL I'm dying: in the expansion microscopy, the polymer they used is sodium acrylate, aka, baby diaper polymer.

   - I think in terms of scalability and economics nothing beats silicon: my naive understanding is that you are subject to the single value of bandgap of silicon, and Shockley–Queisser limit of a bit more than 30%. In multi junction ones you stack layers of materials with different


# Silicon Carbide Waveguides in AR Glasses


Meta has a new post talking a bit more about the silicon carbide waveguides used in the Orion AR glasses.
Funny they mentioned lithium niobate, I wonder how much they suffered (or put to good use) from the birefringence, the pyroelectric effect, the goddamn lithium that diffuses everywhere...

# Wave Propagation and Communication Limits

Every time the OGs write a first author paper, it's either some weird nonsense (fortunately rarely the case), or a pure gem.
This work's approach screams Chu–Harrington limit (and the result is also closely related), which you really should know if you work with rf or antenna of any sort.
While the Chu limit focus on the radiation Q, this is more about how many communication channels you could have from a limited volume: if the surface is too small, the higher order modes will take up too much k on the spherical surface, and there would be no k components left for the outward propagation, and thus the mode "won't propagate much".

I'm again reminded that, if you know how to recognize and count modes properly, you are set for 99% of wave problems.

   - Miller2024: [Tunnelling escape of waves](https://nature.com/articles/s41566-024-01578-w)
   - In short, need larger volume / surface to support more channels.
   - There are some assumptions, such as the medium is homogeneous, isotropic, and linear, so maybe there's room for crazy ideas.

# Post-Quantum Cryptography and NIST Standards

In addition to the recent quantum computing news from the big players, there are also relatively quiet and recent development in post-quantum encryption. It's relevant today because you could "harvest now, decrypt later".

NIST had a call for proposal in 2017, selected 4 quantum-resistant algorithms for standardization in 2022, and released the standards in 2024. Some of them have already been deployed at e.g. AWS.

I don't know how they work (yet), and just thought time flies and these are actually already in action.

# High-Accuracy 3D Face Scanning with Structured Light

This is what you need to scan someone's face with ~100 um RMSE at half a meter away.

It is using structured light from three integrated fringe masks, carefully calibrated and projected with 120 deg phase offset (thus no need for mechanical projectors), plus some magic reconstruction, you get the high accuracy 3D face.

# 2D Metals and Thin-Film Properties

Good news everyone, 2D materials got an application -- hot pressing metals into 2D metals (few angstrom thick).

It's actually hard to press metals down to sub nm thickness, and the grown ones are unstable and have bad thickness control, "due to the high surface energy and high ratio of unsaturated surface atoms of 2D structures".

Why? They have some fancy properties, such as electric field effect much higher than bulk metal.

   - They could get different grain size between slow and fast cooling.

# Soft Robotics and Biomimetic Grippers

Modified Fin Ray Effect (FRE) gripper (same type used on UMI gripper and many other ones) to improve the grip force by >2x and enable more grasp types.

Printed with NinjaFlex filament, and they changed the crossbeam design to have thick and thin part like in a more rigid flexure, as well as added more crossbeams at the tip so it could to mimic fingertip pinching.

   - this is another good drawing.
   - Can you tell your diameter based on the grasp type?

# On-Chip Near-Infrared Spectroscopy

Interesting on-chip NIR spectroscopy. The chip is basically a programmable filter, and they sweep its response. They must be losing a lot of light from any realistic samples into the single mode waveguides.
The photonic circuit is 300 nm thick SiN made by CORNERSTONE. Light source is superluminescent diodes (SLD). I bet they did not go longer wavelengths because the oxide cladding would start being a problem.
