   - everything goes in and out of the square hole

2. Every time I have to drive for a while, I think about a car with tires made of solid kevlar so that it could go at mach 4.6 without the tires disintegrate.

(ignoring all other more important aspects lol)

looking at the picture it might, multiple scatterings off the setup is pretty clear

18. "optical neural network," they said, "it's going to be the new paradigm after Moore’s Law is dead," they said.

Meanwhile, a 3-layer optical DNN:

   - correction, it is only the "first photoelectric multiplication", not the full 3-layer DNN.
Still infinitely better than people who do not include pictures of the actual thing.
   - one day I shall sit down and read the original proposal in details. The core idea is using homodyne/heterodyne detection as the matrix multiplication step, and the optical fanout is relatively easy and energy efficient. I really like the idea.

22. why would you do this (cryo-VCSEL) instead of sending light from room T to 4 K and use a modulator?
even cots bulk modulators have comparable energy-per-bit, and fancy on-chip ones are orders of magnitude better.

   - I do like they have cooled down a cal kit.

   - great question, in principle there is no need, you could do phase modulation, and there will be no power loss from the input photons.
In parctice there will always be insertion loss etc, and it is indeed the dominating energy cost (at least in the case of quantum frequency

many aspects of the process is not scalable, such as this (and variants) is still the sota method to get high quality graphene they need, and you get unpreditable size & quantities of monolayer graphene at random locations on a chip. You can CVD it but

26. directly soldering components onto a chip looks so wrong..

   - there are interposers and PCBs in between with well tested BE and packaging process, the above is directly onto the chip as a one-off lol
(I don't like it also because they are using superconductors on the chip for potential high quality factor/low noise, but then put all these
   - nothing really wrong with this as it's research & non standard
(their chip is not built to host components directly, e.g. UBM has a few layers for putting on solder, while they have YBCO + Au. This is fine for them but might see problem after things like temperature cycling 1000x
