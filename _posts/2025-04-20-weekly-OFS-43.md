# Apollon laser facility vacuum chamber

are there 4+ turbo pumps attached to this big chamber 

(main vacuum chamber of the Apollon laser facility, in Saclay, France)

# Kevlar tires for hypersonic vehicles

Every time I have to drive for a while, I think about a car with tires made of solid kevlar so that it could go at mach 4.6 without the tires disintegrate.

(ignoring all other more important aspects lol)

"optical neural network," they said, "it's going to be the new paradigm after Moore’s Law is dead," they said.

Meanwhile, a 3-layer optical DNN:

   - correction, it is only the "first photoelectric multiplication", not the full 3-layer DNN.
   - Still infinitely better than people who do not include pictures of the actual thing.
   - one day I shall sit down and read the original proposal in details. The core idea is using homodyne/heterodyne detection as the matrix multiplication step, and the optical fanout is relatively easy and energy efficient. I really like the idea.

why would you do this (cryo-VCSEL) instead of sending light from room T to 4 K and use a modulator?

# Direct soldering on superconducting chips

directly soldering components onto a chip looks so wrong..
![20250420_031256_0.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20241122_20250420/20250420_031256_0.jpg)
   - Russo2025: [Superconducting microwave oscillators as detectors for ESR spectroscopy](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0260098)
   - nothing really wrong with this as it's research & non standard 
   - (their chip is not built to host components directly, e.g. UBM has a few layers for putting on solder, while they have YBCO + Au. This is fine for them but might see problem after things like temperature cycling 1000x)

# Acoustic detection of frequency comb CEP

you could listen to how air gets zapped by the pulses from a frequency comb, to detect the carrier-envelope phase (CEP).

(the blurry image of the setup is all they got..)

# Projects


Procrastinating:
- Droplet walker
- TabTreeTracker
- Low cost robot arm
- Joystick doomscrolling


Planning:
- Wave demo with ~ 300 Hz water surface wave + 3D printed components


Ongoing:
- WIMS (where is my shit):
   - week 5 (43): no progress this week, continue wearing it.
   - week 4 (42): switched to a LiPo battery, it lasts several days!
   - week 3 (41): got a usb type-C power monitor. Sleep power too high, need debug
   - week 2 (40): Started wearing the camera at home & send thru wifi to desktop. Need to somehow save or send the photo to my phone when outside.
   - ![WIMS](/assets/images/projects/WIMS-20250330.png)
   - week 1 (39): I finally connected to the camera. Quality bad. Ordered new camera (OV5640) from aliexpress.
- Quantum frequency conversion plot
   - week 4 (41): procrastinating
   - week 3 (40): procrastinating
   - Week 2 (39): published it, currently has piezo-optomechanical approaches
