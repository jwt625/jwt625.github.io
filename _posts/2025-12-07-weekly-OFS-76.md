# Piezoelectric MEMS spatial light modulator with MHz modulation

quiz: what are the fundamental limits and practical limits of how fast and how optically broadband can you change how big of a single optical mode? (this is a piezo MEMS based DMD-like device, "supporting >100 MHz modulation speeds", but the response is nasty)
![20251202_063831_0.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20250113_20251208/20251202_063831_0.jpg)
   - the device shifts its reflection wavelength by squeezing the grating. Amazing device. The sensitivity curve shows you all the nasty mechanical resonance modes.

   - theres a tradeoff between diffraction device's size and optical bandwidth. this quiz is honestly too open, e.g. the mode size can be changed and the modulation device does not need to be directly applied to a big mode depending on the scenario. Steering the beam (change k) is also harder than freq mod.

# Lithium niobate versus silicon for quantum phononic circuits

lithium niobate is not created by god and you gotta think twice when you'd like to use it, esp. at microwave freq and for quantum stuff. Please only use it where absolutely necessary e.g. for transduction. (personal opinion)
![20251205_072856_0.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20250113_20251208/20251205_072856_0.jpg)
   - like, there are so many ways to make good mirrors, why are you making mirrors with crap metal, it might be fine for SAW but here the wave is much more confined. (it does reuse the same process step which is nice)

   - in short, do this instead. Silicon is the best.

# Ultra-low loss 3D waveguide crossings with smooth ramps

one of the wildest and best performant interlayer photonic circuit coupler, what in the world, how are you gonna do this aligned and timed CMP ( it uses the "edge rounding" effect inherent to CMP. Also achievable with reflowed photoresist, as well as hovering mask during plasma etch, but i havent seen people making interlayer photonic crossover with these two. )
![20251205_074711_0.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20250113_20251208/20251205_074711_0.jpg)
   - IL below 0.002 dB and crosstalk below -62 dB.

   - yes this is the one where they used a hovering mask to get a smooth ramp.
