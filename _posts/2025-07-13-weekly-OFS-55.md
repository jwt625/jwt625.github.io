# Cryogenic transition-edge sensor design

Look at that precision-machined copper stage. The tasteful thickness of the gold plating. Oh my God even the island is suspended on monocrystalline silicon flexures.

(transition-edge sensor (TES) for cryogenic decay energy spectrometry (DES, first time heard this), look at all those lil filter chips with "big" inductors)

   - sometimes we use SEM sample clips but yes
   - i do think it's mainly for quick turnaround testing tho, people will do silver paste or ge varnish for more proper packaging
   - ive made some nice looking filters

# Diamond chip fabrication for ion traps

what the hell is this, WHAT IS THIS?? HOW??

   - because im curious how/where did these ion trap people got their diamond chip with cutouts like these.

   - the newer designs of the trap chip can be seen here, i still have a lot of questions from this paper:
   - fibers could get charged due to scattered laser light? (ok this one is understandable)
   - why quartz v-groove chip? Isn't silicon more conductive and better for discharge?
   - why photonic crystal fiber?

# Laser-induced acoustic desorption for nanoparticle trapping

one way to load nanoparticles into an optical trap is to shock them off a metal foil with a laser pulse (LIAD: laser-induced acoustic desorption)

is it using momentum of the light? Nope, it's the acoustic shock wave from thermo-mechanical stress.

typical laser pulse used: few ns, ~10 mJ, and few hundred um spot size.

   - "The goal is to measure the mass of dispensed fluid of 1 mgâ€“5 mg with a relative uncertainty of less than 0.05%"
   - for comparison fujifilm Dimatix could produce droplets from 1 to 100 picoliter, or 1e-4 to 1e-6 mg
   - (I guess MEASURE the dispensed mass is different)

   - sad these SEM and TEM images are so obliterated
   - i remember this paper because I saw a cleanroom staff in the acknowledgement. He just retired a while ago, maybe I should interview him.

# Solid-state laser cooling methods

few hundred THz spectrum is very cold at our room temperature, that's one major reason why laser cooling works, but it's usually done on small things.

TIL if you do it right, you could cool down a big block of crystals with lasers, to sub 100 K from RT, all solid-state!

however, cooling power is only 100 mW with a 50 W laser... the best cooling results also need 22 passes, and the alignment is done in air with much lower laser power otherwise the crystal would get cooled too much and get condensation  i wonder why did they not make a cavity for the pump light with the crystal inside, but a non-resonant folded delay line instead

   - this cooling technique is tempting for fiber lasers because it is cooling the fiber from the inside, and has been measured to work at atmospheric pressure albeit a small temperature drop

   - the multi pass cavity they used (original) could get to a delay as long as 3 km, remember this is pre fiber era
   

# Fiber mode mixing in cladding for anti-Stokes fiber cooling

not really semiconductor nanofab but still feng shui: which fiber cladding shapes mix the optical modes better
