This is the first weekly outside five sigma. I'll slowly figure out what is the best format. Right now I'm thinking one sentence, with one image, and one source.

1. The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) was sketched out in 1989 by engineers on the back of "three ketchup-stained napkins", and is still known as the three-napkin protocol.

2. SF is losing population, and a lot more Asian babies in San Benito

3. A 80x60 pixel Mitsubishi Electric thermal diode infrared sensor (MIR8060B1-01-S) is about $150

8. ST microelectronics has demo of SWIR sensor "using quantum dot conversion film on top of the traditional CMOS sensor to lower the cost". Usually SWIR cameras are $10k+. Hope ST starts selling it soon...

11. [Søren Fuglede Jørgensen](https://github.com/fuglede) built a font file which is also a large language model and an inference engine for that model: [llama.ttf](https://fuglede.github.io/llama.ttf/).
