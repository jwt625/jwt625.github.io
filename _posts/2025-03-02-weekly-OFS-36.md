# Project Taara Got on-chip Beam Steering
Google's project Taara is doing long range (20 km) free space optical comm. Now they have a chip for steering the beam ( and potentially correcting the scintillation as well since the aperture got many segments? )

The chip looks amazing, and it looks like a phased array, there are splitter trees and modulators (?).

The size of the aperture / the beam looks like ~5 mm diameter, and that is a Rayleigh length of ~< 15 m at 1.5 um wavelength, or an insertion loss of >30 dB at 1 km, or >60 dB at 20 km, just from divergence of the beam. They must have some really good and fast detectors.

# Electro-Optic and Piezoelectric Properties of Strontium Titanate

Friend's new paper is out on why good electro-optic materials are often also good piezoelectric materials (both proportional to dielectric constant), and why strontium titanate has great potential for cryogenic / quantum applications.

The main thing I learnt during some early discussions was to think of phase transition as a "resonance" in temperature, and you could play fire to get some material properties you desire to blow up by operating close to it.

The best (and worst) materials where interesting things and effects happen, are the ones on the verge of phase transition.
![20250224_035003_0.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20241231_20250303/20250224_035003_0.jpg)

   - Anderson2025: [Quantum critical electro-optic and piezo-electric nonlinearities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15164)
   - When the name of the materials start to not make sense at a glance, that's how you know things are getting serious. They were doing oxygen isotope substitution to push the phase transition closer to make STO just being between paraelectric and ferroelectric.
   - (you can find material names get more complicated also in higher temperature optical phase change materials like GST and GSST)
   ![20250224_035504_0.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20241231_20250303/20250224_035504_0.jpg)

   - It's not a new material, people knew it is paraelectric at low temperature a long time ago. Look how "shaky" the electrons are at low temperature, reaching dielectric constant >2e4, close to some ceramics (but those are very lossy).

   - Scaling of electro-optic and piezoelectric coefficients vs dielectric constant from the paper.
   - Clearly a win for making switches and modulators etc. out of it for quantum applications (let's call it "classical" quantum (?)). But for "quantum" quantum stuff like frequency conversions, do you still win in terms of bandwidth, energy per qubit etc.?

# Silicon Core Fibers for Nonlinear Optics
Wow silicon core fibers exists, with core diameter much smaller (1.3 um instead of 20 um in usual fibers), and much higher propagation loss (0.2 dB/cm at 5 um core diameter).

It's drawn with a CO laser instead of a more common CO2 laser (5.5 um vs 10.6 um), because absorption in silica is lower and the heating is more uniform.

# EUV Light from Tin plasma and highly charged ions

Have you ever wondered how is EUV light generated from laser-produced tin plasma?

A simplified answer is highly charged ions, where the wavefunction scales as 1/Z. The energy level separation scales even faster ~Z^2, hence the wavelength of the emitted light.

If you have a U91+ ion, you could shake some gamma rays out of that last poor electron...

   - The nice rendering is from Torretti2020: [Prominent radiative contributions from multiply-excited states in laser-produced tin plasma for nanolithography](https://nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15678-y)

   - Hyperfine structures and their  linewidths scale even faster... This sounds so messed up. This is how electrons act when they got too stressed out.

   - hot damn I thought the highest E field human ever created is for sure generated by ultrafast high power laser pulses. Turns out it's not even close.
   - (although this is way less available and applicable than a laser pulse) (I spent 20 min looking for an old tweet about Schwinger limit, can't find it. Maybe I'll run into it another day..)
   ![20250227_052728_0.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20241231_20250303/20250227_052728_0.jpg)
   - First reaction: how does this make sense, I would love this for driving on highway
   - And then realized the cross section is for capturing electrons.. of course that would decrease at higher speed, there's no way you run into another car head on and get captured lol.
   - Also the force a typical safety belt could hold is only 10x away from keeping you bounded to your car like an electron to the atom/ion during a ~1 s collision on a highway lol (assuming it takes more force/energy to break your body).
   ![20250227_073740_0.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20241231_20250303/20250227_073740_0.jpg)
   - The way these highly charged ions are made is dramatic. One typical method is using electrons to hit the bounded electrons away. A more exotic method is muon or antiproton induced ionization: "muon is captured by a neutral atom and the atom responds by ejecting all of its electrons"... 
   - Second screenshot is a description that I would've thought chatgpt is making shit up, but I guess reality really is like a drama.

   - ([also at](https://cds.cern.ch/record/187899/files/PhysRevA.38.4395.pdf))
   - They could observe a series of x ray lines as the antiproton getting captured, and some lines would be weaker/gone, corresponding to Auger ionization etc of the electrons, up to the K shell, i.e., they are all gone.

# Circulators in dilfridges
That big array of circulators gets me every single time.

There are so many unsexy challenges need to be solved for the sexy promises to be more realistic, but much fewer people would work on them. Much more efforts spent on the not scalable and short term sexy demos.
If you dare to solve it, the sexy demo chasers will be your customers.

(that said some sexy demos are absolutely necessary)

# Optical Neural Networks and Electronic Bottlenecks
Nice use of saturable absorber for the nonlinearity, and linear for weak backward propagation beam.

Although if you look closely, all the optical compute / neural network demos are bottlenecked by, or the champion(s) behind them are, E2O and O2E components, like the DMD, SLM and CCD/CMOS cameras in many free space ones, and fast EO modulators and photodetectors when the encoding is in the time domain. Majority of the computing is done with electronics (at least for training).

# MMI made with Offsetting single-mode Optical Fibers
Nothing is single-mode in optics/photonics (or at least single-mode in a useful way, yet).

You could splice a single-mode fiber with an offset to excite more modes and make a Mach–Zehnder interferometer.

# Laser-Textured Metal Surfaces for Antibacterial Applications
Using laser to etch and roughen a metal surface could help preventing bacterial attachment.

(although it did not do much compared to the control, it did improve quite some more than the std.)

# Petawatt Electron Beams
The highest power electron beam just reached one pettawatt ( 10 GV * 0.1 MA ), catching up with high power lasers!

Now how do you characterize such beam? I'm still reading, but seems like all indirect: "[the beam] will destroy any diagnostics intercepting the beam in a single shot and thus impose unique challenges of beam diagnostics."
