# Energy and networking bottlenecks in scalable quantum computing

if you believe quantum computing is going to "work" in the next few tens of years, do you recognize who are the infiniband and nvlink for it? we are definitely pre nvlink (2014), do you think we are also pre 1999 infiniband trade group? 1973 (ethernet)? 1969 (arpanet)? maybe we'll get nvlink first for SC qubits, and arpanet for photonic qubits (there are already a few local ones)?

i guess since the qubits are not working so well yet, the networking and energy bottlenecks are not being talked about much, but good to see SC qubit literatures start to cover cooling power per qubit (we were one of the first to start talking about energy per qubit for optical networking of SC qubits), 3He volume per qubit, and capex per qubit (they only briefly brought up the electronics cost).

There is also good news that there are actual examples of large scale cryogenic systems, LHC's total cooling power at 4 K is > 100 kW. The bad news is that the Coefficient of Performance (COP) is worse than 1:200, and that is even with a centralized He refrigeration plant, dilfridges' number is worse than 1:4000. Let's be gentle and assume we can mod dilfridge with centralized He plant and get 1:500, and get 1000 qubits under a 2 W @ 4 K plate, and we get 1 W facility power per qubit for cooling. They assumed 1:1500, so it's probably going to end up being 1~10 W/qubit.

# Rb vapor cell integration with photonic waveguides

there is a problem when you stick a Rb vapor cell to a photonic chip, you have to hit a few Rb atoms off a dispenser pill, and they would deposit onto the exposed photonic waveguide, and pretty much kills light propagation. (they had to reduce the exposed waveguide to as short as 100 um just to feel something) 

well if you think the other way, this would be a great Rb vapor density sensor, and if you could shoot laser at the pill to dispense Rb, you could probably also shoot laser thru the waveguide to cause desorption of the Rb thats onto the waveguide surface. hence their followup work did exactly these, a desorption laser thru the waveguide almost completely got rid of the Rb induced loss, and monitoring the propagation loss during the Rb pill activation lets them develop various weaker and fancier activation pulse sequences to target different Rb vapor densities.

# Pyroelectric effect challenges in lithium niobate devices

before my lithium niobate (LN) appreciation thread, i gotta trash talk about it one more time: pyroelectric effect. as the name suggests, you get electric field from temperature change (but not vice versa as would be the case for a lot of other effects since here entropy is involved. The other direction is electrocaloric effect). This means you can do cool stuff with it, such as rapid heating of a chip to get 100 kV [ref](https://x.com/jwt0625/status/1806362394639372773), but it also means a lot of horrible unexpected stuff could happen if you don't know about it. 

when you bake your chip during fab on a hotplate, the electric field from the temperature change could fry the devices, or even fry and crack the whole substrate. People would add conductive coating or even wrap the chip in aluminum foil during processing to provide discharge paths. And of course it's dependent on crystal cut, and usually worse on z-cut. You'll find literature from the 1980s complaining about channel waveguide MZI drifting more on z-cut LN [ref]( https://doi.org/10.1063/1.96640). 


here is another example where electric field from a LN chip ESD-ed a device on *another* chip during cooldown to 4 K [ref]( https://x.com/jwt0625/status/1806362394639372773). They have to add shielding electrodes to protect those devices and they would survive, and the IDTs on LN chip would still get fried. 

pyroelectric effect also bothered me a few times, and I was not even on z-cut. I had some x-cut thin film LN devices on silicon substrate, mostly released (i.e. floating) with a few anchor points, that suddenly started mysteriously collapsing when cooling down to 4 K. I ruled out CTE mismatch because that won't explain why it suddenly started happening, but it could be pyroelectric + electrostatic pull-in because I may have moved to a new wafer with better crystal quality and worse discharge. So I put extra aluminum electrodes everywhere to short different LN components to the silicon substrate, and they stopped the collapse..

   14. Fix duplicate RPATH in libopenblas, libgfortran, libquadmath using install_name_tool 
   15. Qt5 Peacock launches but Input File tab empty (executable won't run) 
   16. MOOSE repository deleted/corrupted during Qt5 troubleshooting 
   17. Attempt to rebuild with latest MOOSE main branch 
   18. Build fails: missing DynamicArrayWrapper and SemiDynamicSparseNumberArrayGeneric classes 
   19. Version mismatch: MOOSE main (Dec 2025) incompatible with conda libs (May 2025) 
   20. Peacock-trame broken: no executable available 
   21. Remove incompatible MOOSE repository 
   22. Clone MOOSE at 2025-09-05-release tag (May 9, 2025) matching conda package dates 
   23. Build ex08-opt successfully with same environment variables 
   24. Peacock-trame now runs with 3D mesh viewer functional

   - create the x and y axis first, and then use this magic formula to fill the middle: `=LET( c, COMPLEX(B$1, $A2), z_final, REDUCE(0, SEQUENCE(20), LAMBDA(z, i, IF(IFERROR(IMABS(z),0)>2, z, IMSUM(IMPRODUCT(z,z), c)) )), IF(IMABS(z_final)>2, IMABS(z_final), 0) )` 
   - written by gemini
   - doing this because i saw excel/sheets can handle complex number better than i thought

# Thin-film PZT micro-ring modulators for photonics

remember thin film PZT? now there are micro ring modulators with ~ 50 GHz bandwidth, and temperature sensitivity half of a silicon MRM. 

propagation loss sucks in the ring (22 dB/cm) but should get better, and not so bad in straight waveguide (6 dB/cm). EO coefficient is high and the PAM4 is driven with only 300 mV Vpp.

# Electron and photon conversions in network inference

your finger press over ~10 ms closes a switch in a keyboard matrix, during which ~10¹³ electrons flow through pull-up resistors and scan circuitry. Firmware encodes the event, and a microcontroller emits a USB or Bluetooth HID report of a few dozen bytes. the OS services an interrupt in a few us, maps scan codes to characters, and updates 10²~10³ bytes of state in DRAM, stored as charge from ~10⁸ electrons on capacitors refreshed every ~60 ms. 

your browser constructs an HTTPS request of 1~5 kB, which the TCP/IP stack segments into ~1.5 kB payloads matched to the Ethernet MTU. These drive a network interface with SerDes operating at a few GHz, shoving 10⁶~10⁸ electrons per bit. electrical signals propagate a few cm across copper traces, then drive optical transceivers where electrons jump a semiconductor bandgap to emit 10⁶~10⁸ photons per bit at telecom wavelengths. These photons traverse access, metro, and backbone networks, undergoing a dozen electrical <-> optical conversions at endpoints and regeneration sites. 

these photons might further go through hundreds to thousands of kilometers of fiber, amplified every ~100 km by erbium-doped fiber amplifiers via stimulated emission, wavelength-routed by ROADMs, might even bounce off google's MEMS optical circuit switches a few times, and eventually reconverted to electrons by photodiodes at termination and routing boundaries. at the data center, packets are reassembled and delivered to inference servers where GPUs perform matrix multiplications involving ~10¹² model parameters over milliseconds, with transistors toggling at 10¹⁶~10¹⁷ times per second. 

those parameters were produced earlier by training runs lasting weeks to months, using ~10⁴ accelerators drawing who knows how many megawatts of power, shoving 10³⁰~10³³ electrons through transistor channels for the 10²³~10²⁵ floating-point operations. the inference result is serialized into kilobytes of data and transmitted back through the same chain, again undergoing repeated electrical - optical - electrical conversions across access, metro, and backbone networks. 

back on your phone or laptop or whatever, the browser parses the response, updates layout and rendering structures, and issues GPU draw calls that write millions of pixels per frame into a framebuffer at 60~120 Hz. display interfaces stream multiple gigabits per second to an OLED or microLED panel, where the pixels emit roughly 10⁸~10¹¹ visible photons per frame, driven by ~microamp currents over ~microsecond switching intervals. 

those photons traverse a few meters in nanoseconds, absorbed by your retinal photoreceptors, transduced into electrochemical signals, and interpreted by a ~20 W biological neural system. 

end-to-end, you have astronomical numbers of highly coordinated electrons and photons, and dozens of conversions between them (ofc not including training), for a single thought from the little intelligence to appear on a screen and read by you.
   - disclaimer: most of the numbers are from chatGPT and gemini, do your own math.
   <!-- - in total per gpu and sustained, shouldve made it more clear -->
   <!-- - skipped many steps -->
   <!-- - i dont know crap about browser, but i could definitely expand electrons jumping the bandgap into 8 paragraphs lol -->
   <!-- - damn, sorry that happened to you too -->
   <!-- - never thought about it this way.. makes me hate big telcos a bit less -->
