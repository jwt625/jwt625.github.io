## Earth's Core Temperature
(Quote tweeting about doing a PhD, and picking some projects that would involve extreme things that no VC or personal wealth could or would fund)
Yeeess exactly, this kind of stuff. Some questions no one could answer with certainty except nature.
Sometimes you never know when you suddenly would really like to know when or how does iron start to melt under high pressure, other than understanding Earth’s internal process.

## Compact LN Modulator
I remember seeing the hyperlight thin-film LN modulator a while ago and thinking “oh it’s in more like a butterfly package instead of the usual modulator package”.
- Today it just occurred to me again this is because the length needed for same Vpi is 5~10x shorter because of better mode confinement, thus the package is more like ~20 mm instead of ~80 mm length. And they took a laser/receiver butterfly package instead of pushing kyocera or whoever to make a shorter version.

## Electric Ray Energy Experiments
TIL electric rays have a "power density" as high as 10 kW/m^2, which they measured by pressing the head of this poor fella and let it charge up a capacitor / light up an LED.
- However, it became much worse when they tried cutting up the electric organ assembling it into cells. Maybe because the prep time is close to the time limit to avoid organ deterioration (~1 h).
- (the 1e4 W/m^2 might also mean nothing as the voltage and current were measured under different conditions and they were not very careful about the calculation)

## EUV Pellicle
There is a thin film above the EUV photomask called pellicle to keep particles out of focus and reduce their impact.
- It used to be made with 45 nm polysilicon capped with 4.5 nm silicon nitride (to survive the EUV & H2), it's as big as 130x100mm, and gets heat up close to 1000 C under typical EUV power. Sounds already insane right?
- Now this two-million aspect ratio film is made of carbon nanotubes with special coatings to allow better EUV transmission, withstand higher temperature and mechanical loads, and can be used for other applications like debris filtering and fancy gas seals.

Never heard about Cramer-Rao bound before, guess time for some reading.

   - Ok it's very fundamental, you probably know special form of it, and will for sure recognize the simplest example: estimating the mean of a gaussian distribution by the average of N samples:

## Ultra-High-Speed Camera
tfw you have a turbine in your imaging setup, and it's rotating at 20000 rotations per second to get you 25 mega fps

## Floating and Moving Droplets
There's a guy named Walker who wrote in 1978 about making liquid droplet float above a bath by making the bath surface vibrate, and almost 30 years later people found making the surface vibrate & accelerate more could make the droplet self-propels and thus becomes, a walker.
![20250102_074106_0.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20241220_20250104/20250102_074106_0.jpg)
   - Picture from Walker1978: [The Amateur Scientist - Drops of liquid can be made to float on the liquid. What enables them to do so?](https://scientificamerican.com/article/the-amateur-scientist-1978-06/)
   - Movies from Couder2005: [Walking and orbiting droplets](https://nature.com/articles/437208a)
   - And now you have superwalkers (they move faster) by exciting multiple harmonics and playing with the phase.

   - Once you get the droplet bouncing and not merging with the bath, you could make it bigger (up to 3 cm, limited by the depth of their bath!) and it would stay floating for ~ 30 min (?!), because a thin layer of air (~< 1 um) gets trapped and leaks out very slowly.

   - (stay floating even after turning off the vibration)
   - There’s a [veritasium vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIyTZDHuarQ) about it that showed & explained it very well
   

## Nanoimprint grating on fiber
A grating coupler made with nanoimprint using a PDMS mold & UV cure polymer resin, so that it can be made to your need of angle and wavelength etc instead of permanent & fixed on the photonics chip.

## Starshade for Exoplanet Direct Imaging
TIL one of the approaches to directly image an exoplanet (x1e10 dimmer than the star) is called starshade, and it's gorgeous:
It uses a 30~40 m diameter mask with an inner disk and outer petals to kill poisson spot, that has to be made within 100 um tolerance and deployed within 1 mm precision, and thermally stable to within 200 um on-orbit.
The telescope and the mask also have to measure and align laterally within 1 m, while being a few tens of thousands of km away from each other.

   - I love the different ways of folding and unfolding the mask
