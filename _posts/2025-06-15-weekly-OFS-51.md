# SNSPD alignment with silicon etch

I really like that they use the process (silicon etch) and the fiber ferrule to align the SNSPD to the fiber

# Grating coupler backreflection reduction

why did they made the back of the grating coupler with pointy tapers? i have one theory but it is not very convincing.
could also see two shallow craters likely from tiny dirts during the bonding process

   - not sure how strong it would be compared to BR from the left end of the grating. Maybe they found it helps

# Fiber-plugging robotics

pretty sure a while ago I saw a similar robot from one of the big telcos also moving around and capable of unplugging and plugging fibers. Can't find it now...

this kind of search is hard, sometimes I only remember things like one of the figure is mostly red, and the authors names are probably italian, need multimodal RAG.

(I have a RAG endpoint for my tweet backups but have not built a nice frontend yet)

   - It's just the inside and the end tip are rotating, and the speed is so high it's probably faster than the lateral shaking could catch up
