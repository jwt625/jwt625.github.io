# SLM phase mask to intensity pattern quiz

# Grating coupler efficiency on lithium niobate

there is near zero chance the waveguide is designed to be this weird shape. It is very likely resist adhesion issue, and of course there is no discussion on it at all.

# Kyocera metalens for wearable aerial display

wait a second stop right there, this must be false advertising right? why is the editing so damn good. unironically this would be much easier to make than AR glasses.. if iphone air could hide most of the phone in the camera plateau, you could probably make a phone like this and hide the battery and most of the phone in the idk bottom 1/7 of it.

# Force-insensitive rigidly mounted optical cavity

this must feel soo good for the cavity ( it is a force insensitive design, rigidly mounted optical cavity, insensitive to inertial forces acting in any direction and to the compressive force used to constrain it )

# High-Q Ta2O5 microring resonator coupling region

   - the Ta2O5 waveguides are a bit too big. this sexy of a height profile of course involved some mechanical shit, but calling it just CMP is not sexy enough so they got a fancy name for it: photolithography-assisted chemo-mechanical etching (PLACE)

   - Montifiore2026: [Blue to Near-IR Integrated PZT Silicon Nitride Modulators for Quantum and Atomic Applications]( https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15695) 
   - I think I still hold the highest measured piezo-optomechanical tuning rate (or any linear tuning rate), with a much much less practical design.

# On-chip multimode optoelectronic neural network

# cQED calculator and hardware software challenges

when you are complaining about ai slop, have you considered how much slop already exist? Existing old slop, so old that new slop would not look like slop. If you could combine the two, it would easily look pretty out of the distribution. 

anyway if you work with circuit QED (aka microwave circuits with josephson junctions), here is a handy calculator from one of my friend: [cQED Designer]( https://c-qed.com) 

there is a lot of potential especially in academia and education. Many repeated and redundant self-inflicted suffering being glorified and framed as novel breakthroughs, and getting justified to be secretive. True experiences, knowledges and wisdoms stayed and decayed in meat brains and HDDs that never get accessed again. LLMs are from the software and internet world, and they make it so much easier to push many other domains to be into software and internet, to be more accessible and sharable. Take advantage of them. 

you are a hardware bro and you like trash talking about software? Do i need to tell you how much the software in hardware industries suck, and how unscalable first-order hardware work is? I'm not against you driving every screws and bolts and soldering every components and jumpwires and hand wash every beakers, but at some point you'll be writing and maintaining software for hardware.

# Ultrawide bandgap MgSiN2 thin films via MOCVD

I no longer yearn for laser eyes that can see optical spectroscopy results, now I yearn for electron beam eyes with x-ray detection retina so that I could see elements. (energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS)) MgSiN2 is an interesting material, it has a huge direct bandgap of 6.3 eV which means transparency down to ~100 nm, refractive index of 2.4 which is even higher than AlN, and can be grown with MOCVD on sapphire.

   - week 82:
      - made a [parody website](https://github.com/jwt625/PlayGround/tree/main/20260117_realfab) mimicing the [realfood.gov](https://realfood.gov). Used claude code to mimic it as much as possible. Quite a lot of effort, took hakf a day to get the landing / on load animation and the problems section working. Gemini is pretty bad at describing animations. Did not finish and did not deploy it.
      - also made the hero video for this parody ralfab project, msotly with claude: [readfab announcement (parody)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_u3ubn5D0O8). Narrator voice from ElevenLabs.
      - made a [bad apple ver. with spatial light modulator (SLM)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWsCV2V8U-E) with Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm because claude can do it.
