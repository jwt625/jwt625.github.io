Otherwise the electrodes would get too narrow & lossy & have self resonances.\nThis is made possible because people figured out how to do poling with fs lasers ~10 years ago, making it much more versatile.",

Making the mode bigger is one of the most straightforward way to get higher power, however you get more modes and their effective index are also much closer to each other.\nLarge pitch fiber is one way to deal with these higher order modes (HOM), by arranging extra holes in a clever way. It makes the HOM much lossier because they see more boundaries, and less overlapping with the gain region at the center.\nTheir core diameter is ~100 um, and could support ~300 W of CW power and few GW of peak power.",

Making the mode bigger is one of the most straightforward way to get higher power, however you get more modes and their effective index are also much closer to each other.\nLarge pitch fiber is one way to deal with these higher order modes (HOM), by arranging extra holes in a clever way. It makes the HOM much lossier because they see more boundaries, and less overlapping with the gain region at the center.\nTheir core diameter is ~100 um, and could support ~300 W of CW power and few GW of peak power.",
