1. If car fuel efficiency improves similarly as Moore’s law for compute, we’d have cars with 110 light year range now

2. The number of transistors we are making per second (1e14~1e15?) is very far from the number of new born bacteria per second (>1e23)

3. "Single-chip photonic deep neural network" from MIT (on arxiv Aug 2022, and just got out on nature photonics). Nice seeing detectors/receivers integrated onto the same chip, and the photocurrent directly sent to modulators.
Light source when.

5. Did you know (I didn’t) that single use beverage cups (SUBC) like what you’d get ordering coffee has a ~30 um polyethylene liner, and that could generate enough nanoparticles to give one for each of your cells (15 trillions) after 13 cups.
- It’s “well under FDA’s mass based limit”, but the authors argue the mass limit might not capture enough of the potential health effects.

6. NIST has a nice series of “how do you measure it” articles and they are quite good.
I had no idea they have a 60 meter long underground tunnel to calibrate tape measures, with accuracy of 0.1 mm, and they’ve measured tapes as long as 1 km.

7. This video, although only indirectly related, just keeps reminding me of étendue, a very fundamental and under appreciated property of light in an optical system.
It’s the “volume” of light in phase space. It’s conserved or can only be increased, like entropy.
![20241205_024214_0.jpg](/assets/images/2024/20240702_20241207/20241205_024214_0.jpg)

   - The real seeing around the corner is called non-line-of-sight imaging. You could reconstruct the whole scene if you have good enough detector to measure above noise & resolve in time domain multibounces of the light.
And there are people doing up to fifth bounce

9. I dare you, I double dare you, to actually bend your Trojan light beam as much as in your illustration  
The beam is guided by the optical analogy of Lagrange points, or as I would like to think of it as equivalent to a rotating saddle holding a ball.
(There is a reason they choose a spot size of ~100 um and the helix pitch of ~6 cm, because that's almost exactly the Rayleight length of that beam.)
![20241205_064734_0.jpg](/assets/images/2024/20240702_20241207/20241205_064734_0.jpg)

(also at: [Guiding Trojan beam](https://physics.muni.cz/~tomtyc/teorfyzzaj/guiding_trojan_beams.pdf))
   - Heating the PDMS decreases its refractive index locally, and would push the beam away from it (as in Fig. 3g above). By making the heater into a helix, they could keep pushing the beam back. You know what this would look like when helix pitch -> 0? A gradient index waveguide!

10. "The optical compute interconnect (OCI) chiplet of Intel’s Integrated Photonics Solutions Group, shown next to a pencil eraser."
The chip does 4-terabit-per-second bidirectional connection with 5 pJ/bit, using 8 fibers and each with 8 wavelengths DWDM.

If you look very closely, you could actually see eight lanes / channels on the chip (for the 8 fibers), each with what seems to be two rows of ring resonators and eight in each row, likely for the transmit and receive of the eight wavelengths.

11. “Yes it got this one mode-hop free range that’s big enough to write a nature paper!”
Jokes aside it’s cool seeing piezo MEMS, SiN photonics and DFB put together.

Look at those broken wirebonds that did not get removed! Tip of the iceberg of the grad school suffering (and joy) right there.

12. Here's a nice piece of polished ulexite aka television stone, because it has natural parallel fiber bundles that could guide light.
Some shells also do the same thing for their little symbiotic algae friends: they have microlenses with bundled “fiber optic cables” under it with um level resolution  so that they could pass sunlight thru the shell and stay closed.
They also transmit ~30% of the good sunlight, and only ~14% the bad UV.

   - More stiff than I expected along other dof. Also look pretty wire EDM-able?

   - The pivoting motion is the fundamental mode, and is 4x less stiff in terms of eigen frequency. Color is displacement field norm.

   - Found a relevant presentation, they reviewed existing crossed flexure pivot (CFP), and introduced their new design called Triple crossed flexure pivot (TRIVOT)

   - The motivation is to reduce the parasitic center shift and increase the maximal stroke

17. Photonic ribbon cable that's made of silicon nitride waveguide cladded in silicon dioxide flexure instead of TPP 3d printed!
Just a demo though, no insertion loss from the actual PRC yet.

18. TIL there's a type of spiders called ray spiders: they would tension up the net into a cone, detect the direction and distance of flying prey, and then release and slingshot towards the prey at up to 50 g (?!), capturing it mid-flight within 38 ms.
The two videos are slowed down by ~17x and ~33x.

   - To be fair, for constant strain-stress and comparable density, object size * acceleration is a constant. They are ~ 1 mm, so 50g for them would feel like 0.5g for us.

19. The environmental thermal loads for a satellite might be more complicated than you expect, e.g. “the diffusely reflected solar flux is about one-third of the direct solar flux and is referred to as the albedo flux.”
COMSOL has an Orbital Thermal Loads interface that helps you track the orbit and orientation of the satellite, and the corresponding distributions of each thermal source and sink.

20. Seeing “Rabi oscillation” wrt number of gates in the thousands because of small miscal in amplitude/frequency 
(This is a 1e-7 error rate single qubit gate)
