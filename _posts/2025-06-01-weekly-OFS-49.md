# Fiber-to-chip coupler with sub-dB loss

self-aligning broadband fiber to chip coupler with < 0.5 dB loss!

it's so broadband their source can't measure the 1 dB excess IL BW 

(I like this a lot, except I thought the pins are thru the chip with DSE but they are actually also TPP printed, better be careful when you plug it)

# Glass 3D printing with HSQ resist

print and "heat shrink", this time with glass, from the same team

The resin is silsesquioxanes based, which you'll recognize immediately if you've worked with HSQ resist.

   - The glass 3d printing paper itself is from 2023. The POSS resin needs ebeam or much shorter wavelength light exposure to be cross linked (?), hence they cross-link it with acrylate, and then convert to fused silica by baking at 650 C. RMS roughness of the printed microlenses is

# Piezoelectric microwave photon detection

im telling you, the least interesting part here is also going to be the most annoying and tricky part (the piezo)

(silicon vacancy coupled to a microwave resonator via a piezoelectric transducer, for single microwave photon detection)
