# Thoughts

Drones, robotic arms, and LLM wrappers. Mostly additional software on top of existing hardware and software. Definitely still a lot of effort.

Hard to build deeper new things in such a short amount  of time with limited man hours.

I should get my robotic arm running... Been procrastinating for too long...
