# Chip-Scale Cold Atom Systems

here is another one in the wild!
makes you think is it really that easy to couple a SOA to a PIC huh

   - accuracy ~ 92%

# Fiber Optic Transmission Trends

we have 50 more years until the whole earth's land is covered by data centers lol

# Scientific Image Upscaling

my new addiction: upscale crap scientific photos

( it added a lot more wirebonds.. )
![20250918_045249_0.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20250323_20250928/20250918_045249_0.jpg)

   - a lot of potential in upscaling scientific photos, like i could recognize many of these components (like that detector/amplifier from FEMTO), and could find and offer reference images.

# Laser-Actuated Photonic Origami

Projectile Dysfunction

(man I really need to figure out how to download the video from twitter)

( folding silica sheets in < 1 ms with a CO2 laser )
   - angle controllable by sending pulses.
   - Upper side of the silica heats up to ~3000 K, acceleration ~2000*g

   - I am disappointed that they did not explain why the single point heating leads to ~ 90 deg max bending.

# Integrated Lithium Niobate Photonic Circuit

   - i really like how down to the earth this prototype is, take a processor, remove the lid, kapton tape to a 4 in wafer carrier, and spin coat & DIRE as usual, you can do this too.
   - (ofc to do this at scale you start a company like they did)

# Hyperspectral Reconstruction from RGB

this makes sense but still surprising it works this well.

this is spectral reconstruction from RGB values from a smartphone camera, they co-designed a spectral color chart with a reconstruction algo, and achieved ~ 2 nm spectral resolution from a single photo.

<!-- - nice, did it match some of the known absorption spectrum?
some of my friends are working on various spectroscopy -->
   - you do need to calibrate the sensors with a known light source, and then you can measure anything else
   <!-- - i think you have to assume the stuff to be measured (lighting or the concentration of the gas/liquid) is uniform across the area of the chart, so yes
   - 2 nm res is really damn good -->

# Large-Scale Optical Tweezer Array

# Optically Driven Metamachines

babe wake up we got a sisyphus nanomachine for photons

(this stupid tweet reached 2.1M views...)

( scale bars are 5 um and 10 um )
   - i thought it's mostly TPP, but it's actually mostly SiO2 + SU8 with EBL and photolitho, and a-Si as sacrificial layer for releasing the structure. The grating is a-Si then capped with SiO2.

   - both by light

   - it is powered by light, but it needs a laser that has 1e4 times of sunlight's power density
   - is this what i think it is
   - theres an array of grating on the rod bouncing off the light, and getting the kicks from the photons
   - the rack is also pushed by light towards the right
   - move things around
   - they ran it for a few hours, and then have to clean it with DI water
   - analog but not quantum
   - lool more like massage gun for tardigrades -->

   - ( if you know someone work on NLO with LN this should be a very simple question, go test them lol )
   - GPT5 got it after i kick its ass twice
   - ( and TM should also radiate much worse out of plane to the top view camera )

   - I got a question on optics design simulation tools:
   > i'm more familiar with the on-chip stuff, where the sim tools are FDTD and FEM (lumerical, comsol, synopsis beamprop, flexcompute tidy3d etc), and you could build your own circuit level sims using pytorch, or use [sax](https://flaport.github.io/sax/).

   > there are many people here who are experts in free space optics stuff, @apraxophobia does noblinear optics for fs lasers, and @BobNiffenegger's lab developed a [code to CAD optical layout tool](https://websites.umass.edu/rniffenegger/pyopticl-code-to-cad-optical-layout/)
   <!-- - yes, should have added "on-chip" -->

      - should really continue one-click-paper-page!
   - week 63:
      - Continuing [one click web paper](https://github.com/jwt625/PlayGround/tree/main/20250831_one_click_paper_page). Got actual deployment working. Had to refactor backend etc.
      - Also added traffic speed to [Bay Bridge traffic](https://bay-bridge-traffic.com). The repo was spun off from PlayGround last weekend iirc.
      ![BBT-speed](/assets/images/2025/BBT-speed.png)

      - I think it is already getting hit hard and slowing down the detection, might have to take this down
      - nope not really getting hit hard, not sure what it was, added some rate limiting and restarted things, now back to 30 fps most of the time
