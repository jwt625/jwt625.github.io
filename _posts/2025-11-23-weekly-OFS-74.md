# Soliton self-frequency shift for tunable lasers

[ref tweet](https://x.com/jwt0625/status/1981612406481858646)

what picture do you have in your head when you think about a widely tunable laser? external cavity with a motorized rotating grating (see quoted tweet)? parametric process + tunable phase matching? supercontinuum + tunable filter?

TIL there is a process called soliton self-frequency shift (SSFS), you launch a soliton (a fs pulse) into a fiber, and Raman scattering shifts the wavelength to longer, which is further amplified by the remaining shorter wavelength part of the pulse thru Raman, and this process keeps going. The higher pump/pulse power, the more red-shifted the final pulse is, and you can go up to watt level *average* power with large mode area fibers, and hundreds of nanometers of tuning. It's used in three-photon microscopy a lot (mouse brain imaging etc).

      - Continued [DocEater](https://github.com/jwt625/DocEater)
         - started parsing all safe pdfs in my download folder. Actually as I type here (Sun Nov  9 23:28:59 PST 2025) it just finished the first pass:

<pre><code>================================================================================

   - week 63:
      - Continuing [one click web paper](https://github.com/jwt625/PlayGround/tree/main/20250831_one_click_paper_page). Got actual deployment working. Had to refactor backend etc.
      - Also added traffic speed to [Bay Bridge traffic](https://bay-bridge-traffic.com). The repo was spun off from PlayGround last weekend iirc.

      - I think it is already getting hit hard and slowing down the detection, might have to take this down
      - nope not really getting hit hard, not sure what it was, added some rate limiting and restarted things, now back to 30 fps most of the time
