1. Folks I just ran into a colored version of this. From a book on microwave tubes from 2020 and with all figures in color would you believe it! (it's so new they are called vacuum electron devices instead of tubes).
Of course there's no colored version of the other cartoon lol.

2. How to build a quantum supercomputer from HP, Fermi Lab, NASA Ames, RIACS... Nice seeing discussion on yield, wiring, and floorplan for dilfridge cluster.
Claude grabbed the numbers. Some other ones:
One 12in wafer = 20k SC qubits.
A $5M 150-qubit cryostat spends $4M on wiring.

3. The poster and presentation for this pasta drying simulation is out. It includes heat & mass transfer, glass transition, solid mechanics & hygroscopic swelling.

4. About to complain that nanometer level flatness is either a misinterpretation or a lie, but it’s actually the case even in 2007: TTV on the whole 12in wafer ~40 nm and ~10 nm on a single reticle. That’s 2ft across width of the USA
Also look at this freaking lens for measuring it.

5. Did they 3d print the cover?
This is Q.ANT's "first commercial product – a photonics-based Native Processing Unit built on their compute architecture: Light Empowered Native Arithmetics", which includes Thin-Film Lithium Niobate (TFLN) on Insulator chips.
They have a MNIST demo..

6. People should include more tapeouts in their theses

7. Hell yeah, Poisson's spot using COMSOL electromagnetic waves, beam envelopes.
It took me more than 1 h to realize I was doing 2D but I should be doing axial 2D... In 2D there's basically not spot (i.e., a slab Gaussian beam and a slab obstacle, comparison in the last pic)

   - Also I cheated using radially polarized beam, otherwise it is not axial symmetric..
   - This poisson's spot simulation was instigated by this paper on why we do not see it from solar eclipse. Wanna guess the answer?

8. Got a fiber optic HDMI cable and opened it up
![20241121_063026_0.jpg](/assets/images/2024/20240608_20241127/20241121_063026_0.jpg)
![20241121_063026_1.jpg](/assets/images/2024/20240608_20241127/20241121_063026_1.jpg)

![20241121_063026_3.jpg](/assets/images/2024/20240608_20241127/20241121_063026_3.jpg)
   - There is an array of four fibers, the end of which seems to be exposed in a narrow trench of between two injection molded (could see a gate vestige) light guide (?) and fiber holder, locating pins ~5x diameter of the fiber. Could also see a few wirebonds through the light guide.
   ![20241124_180639_0.jpg](/assets/images/2024/20240608_20241127/20241124_180639_0.jpg)
   ![20241124_180639_1.jpg](/assets/images/2024/20240608_20241127/20241124_180639_1.jpg)
   ![20241124_180639_2.jpg](/assets/images/2024/20240608_20241127/20241124_180639_2.jpg)\
   - I think it’s multimode so not as sensitive, and there are two injection molded parts, one aligned to the vcsel chip maybe on one or two of its edges, and the second one holding the fibers is aligned to the one enclosing the chip with pins
   - they also have wires running the whole cable for power
   ![20241124_214657_0.jpg](/assets/images/2024/20240608_20241127/20241124_214657_0.jpg)
   - When you wanna run it for > 10 m or so. The electrical version has carrier freq of few hundred MHz to ~ 1 GHz and decays too quickly. Either need an active cable or fiber optic.

12. PDMS/MXene film based triboelectric nanogenerator...
They show it could charge up a 2 uF capacitor with 14 blows of 800 N force to 3.6 V, and sense different moves. They kept punching it for 30,000 times and  checked over 35 days to see its long term stability.
Its max power output to an optimal load (40 MOhm) is 4.4 mW/cm^2, however not sure how impressive this is as the number and even the unit seem to be everywhere for energy harvesting device.

13. TIL there is a company trying to figure out 3D printing houses on the moon.
It's a fun environment, you get no air for cooling fans, but also free vacuum for any of your scientific or semiconductor fab need. And you also get "room T" superconductors at night.
