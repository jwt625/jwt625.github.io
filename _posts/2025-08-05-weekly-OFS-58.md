# PZT-enabled microcomb bandwidth analysis

here is another one that is 16 meters

   - they also have a really good looking uscope image of the PZT tunable ring

   - a higher res version
   - How is the bandwidth so crap? The delay from the separation between the actuator and the waveguide should give a cap of 300 MHz, so maybe it takes 10x slower for things to settle down?
   - I have a device with 0.1x the bandwith and 10000x the tunability. Not a ring resonator though.

grating coupler too close to the detector i don't like it

# Muon tomography for pyramid scanning

how do you find hidden chambers in a pyramid?
- you take an "x-ray image" of the pyramid with cosmic ray muons.

- (sadly they did not find any: "no chambers with volumes similar to the four known chambers in Cheops's and Sneferu's pyramids exist in the mass of limestone investigated by cosmic-ray absorption")
- Newer study in 2017 found a large void

maybe time for a collection of photonic chip thats actually mostly routing

(tbf sometimes the routing is the device)

# Acoustic levitation with single focus

there are a few ways to do acoustic levitation on objects larger than wavelength, most of them not so robust.
These folks from University of Tokyo did it by moving a single focus very quickly around the objects.
It reminds me of ion traps lol.
