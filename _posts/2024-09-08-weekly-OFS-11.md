1. This is the first time I see an AWG (arrayed waveguide grating) looking like this, to achieve narrow channel widths (< 1 GHz) over a wide bandwidth (140-190 GHz) for a space-based microwave radiometry application. This resolution translates to 1 ns delay or 9 cm length diff.

2. A dc-biased Josephson junction in series with two microwave resonators emits entangled beams of microwaves leaking out of the resonators

3. Google showed their surface code is getting better with higher distance. This very roughly means that the superconducting qubits are goos enough for quantum computing, the question is now how and how fast can it scale.

4. Behold, we will soon have microbatteries in our brains and balls (not really, but they actually have comparable sizes). And you could use it to power electrochemical actuators for micro-robots.

5. The volume of the unit sphere peaks at a dimensionality of exactly 5, and the area peaks at 7 dimensions.

6. This is one of my favorite paper, from the S of the RSA, on how to share a secret to n people while you need k of them to help you decode it. Any (k-1) people would have no idea what it is.

7. Chemical oxygen–iodine laser (COIL), as well as other chemical lasers, are basically putting two mirrors around a rocket engine exhaust.

8. Want your kids to be more stress-tolerant, grow faster and stronger? Record your fights with your breeding partner and replay it to your kids before they were born! That's what these science weirdos did to seagull eggs and found out about...

9. Science hippies watch bees jerking off flowers and then jerk off flowers themselves. The bees could do it at 400 Hz!

10. This is not just robots on mushroom, this is mushroom roots controlling robots with their electrical signals... Would you raise the fungi, and then use a 24-bit ADC and going thru the EMI shielding hussle to sense ~ 100 uV signal from fungi roots to actuate your robot?

12. Thomas Wilfred’s art looks like AI generated light field animation, but it is actually fully mechanical. And the beautiful thing is, his patent on it just turned 100 years old.

13. When you didn't have FEM, you would bruteforce thru the math, build an equivalence of your structure in plastic, and directly measure & visualize the solution.

14.  The astronomers (the AWG paper at the beginning of this blog) and high energy physicists having the coolest shit. This paper is GPU accelerated optical photon simulation, but the photons are from a 200 GeV muon.
