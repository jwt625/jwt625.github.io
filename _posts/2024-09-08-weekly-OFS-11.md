1. This is the first time I see an AWG (arrayed waveguide grating) looking like this, to achieve narrow channel widths (< 1 GHz) over a wide bandwidth (140-190 GHz) for a space-based microwave radiometry application. This resolution translates to 1 ns delay or 9 cm length diff.

2. A dc-biased Josephson junction in series with two microwave resonators emits entangled beams of microwaves leaking out of the resonators

3. Google showed their surface code is getting better with higher distance. This very roughly means that the superconducting qubits are goos enough for quantum computing, the question is now how and how fast can it scale.

4. Behold, we will soon have microbatteries in our brains and balls (not really, but they actually have comparable sizes). And you could use it to power electrochemical actuators for micro-robots.

5. The volume of the unit sphere peaks at a dimensionality of exactly 5, and the area peaks at 7 dimensions.

6. This is one of my favorite paper, from the S of the RSA, on how to share a secret to n people while you need k of them to help you decode it. Any (k-1) people would have no idea what it is.

7. Chemical oxygenâ€“iodine laser (COIL), as well as other chemical lasers, are basically putting two mirrors around a rocket engine exhaust.

8. Want your kids to be more stress-tolerant, grow faster and stronger? Record your fights with your breeding partner and replay it to your kids before they were born! That's what these science weirdos did to seagull eggs and found out about...

9. Science hippies watch bees jerking off flowers and then jerk off flowers themselves. The bees could do it at 400 Hz!
