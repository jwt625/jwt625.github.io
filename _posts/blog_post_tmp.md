1. The real sweet electronics is the edible electronics

2. Folks I just found the coolest phd thesis I have seen so far! It's about acoustic ecology of lobsters.

   - Now I feel like I should have taken more time... I have wasted my opportunity to include more cool shit in mine... From:

3. This is sick. You might remember the work using wifi to image people behind walls, now they showed you can sense breathing with wifi. 20 dB more SNR you’ll pbb be able to sense heart rate!

   - I remember posting about the seeing through walls with wifi but can’t find the post.. well here is the project page:
   - And a master thesis on See Through Walls with Wi-Fi. I’m gonna start calling myself an inverse synthetic aperture. https://mit.edu/~fadel/papers/Fadel_MS.pdf…

4. One thing I found mind breaking yesterday and today is that, ink jet printing can be faster than FIVE METER PER SECOND.
Consumer level functional metarial ink jet printer when? (e.g. print CuO nanoparticles then reduce & sinter with laser to get conductive lines)

   - People are already doing it for chemistry/microfluidics (did you find a familiar name?)
Printer: Epson EcoTank L805, < $500 used, could directly print on CD/DVD, which is how they mount their substrate
Droplet spot 40~70 um
Alignment accuracy ~ 10 um
Homogeneity across a DVD ~ 1%
