# 400G optical transceiver teardown

Cisco Finisar 400G DR4, converting 8x 50G to 4x 100G PAM4. I could see two EMLs, not sure where are the other two or they split them.
- from comments seems like it is further split on the PIC

# Superconducting nanowire detectors

Nice fresh review on superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs).

It also has one of the most confusing performance record plot I've seen

# Personalized paper recommendations

Trying out this personalized paper recommendation.

Be wary you could only add five authors for the initial bootstrapping, and I made it heavily photonics/quantum..

# Optical scanning probe microscopy

I don't care about the topological device, but this *optical* scanning probe is sick, imaging directly measuring the field distribution of the light (fig. 2A), and compare to simulation (fig. 2B). And it's heterodyne so you also get the phase!

(maybe they did not show it because it does not match with sim as well. Also why different colorbar for sim and measurement...)

# Automated 2D material exfoliation

Look what I ran into today: QPress Exfoliator at Brookhaven National Lab.

It's "a fully mechanized exfoliation platform" in argon glovebox. They have "developed and optimized exfoliation recipes for high-demand materials such as graphene, hBN, and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)".

They also have a Cataloger and a Stacker downstream.

(ngl I've also used thorlabs posts as fixtures and guides many times)

someone did my "dumb" idea! (that I did not follow thru)

# Photonics vs VLSI progress

honestly the gap might be more than 50 years apart.
(or we are still early!)

you can get a 6502 with 25 bucks in 1975 ($150 today, image from visual6502), meanwhile the sota photonics are research demos with "1 million photonic components" (unclear how it's counted), or subtle note that the architecture is "incoherent".

(maybe I should look into and compare with how VLSI research is like in teh 1970s)

The relatively transparent ones with large component counts are from psiquantum and MEMS otical switch folks at Berkeley (nEYE Systems), where you could see the components and component specs, and even wafer maps of fab variations.

The ones you could buy now are transceivers and interconnects, and they have few tens to few hundreds of components. Some phased array lidars have a few thousands of components. Lightmatter's Passage M1000 likely will have few tens of thousands, it's so big you could get max 12 or 13 per 12 in wafer, and thats very roughly 100 bucks just from the price of the SOI wafer..

I'm derailing too much. I'm just a bit sad that a random person can't buy a SiPho chip as affordable and useful as IC chips from 50 years ago. What you can buy that are close to SiPho are old transceivers, maybe the first step is to figure out something fun with them.

# Quantum computing in robotics

robotics folks finding out quantum computing is hard

# Dry EEG electrode advancements

A review on EEG electrodes, there are four big performance tables of different types of them.

(EEG: electroencephalogram, the method you could use to read your own mind non-invasively, and have better stock investment choices)

   - ok the stock forcast work was using fMRI not EEG, but you could probably do it with EEG?

# High-power klystron testing

man I love paper with pictures of the actual setup. Look at this hot damn klystron. Peak power of 50 MW. That's how I want to microwave my food.

(the food will be turned into a plasma ball lol)
