# IBM and Copper Interconnects  
IBM has some high quality technical and historical articles with unique materials, only if they are a bit more in depth..
Here is one about copper interconnects.

# Magnetically Programmed Diffractive Robotics 
Diffractive robotics?? I should have called my stuff quantum optomechanical robotics.
- scroll down and see the whole thing moves around

Ok fair fair

(But if the thing not being anchored counts as robotics, can I call surface acoustic waves robotics? You could spawn them on demand, they could move stuff from single electrons to liquid droplets around, and they could be quantum! Quantum robotics!)

# Mantis Shrimp and Phononic Shields
Mantis shrimps have a phononic shield?? (to protect their clubs from ns shock waves due to the cavitation bubbles)
- And it is even chirped pitch to be broadband???
This used to be suggested, and now it is direct experimental measurement with laser ultrasonic spectroscopy. Reinforcement learning man, nature used it to design phononic shield way before we did.

(a periodic change in mechanical properties could give rise to acoustic/mechanical bands similar to electronic band structure in a periodic atomic crystal lattice, and can form a bandgap that stops the acoustic wave propagation at certain frequencies similar to an insulator stopping current flows.)

   - Key techniques are transient grating spectroscopy (TGS) and asynchronous optical sampling (ASOPS)
   - TGS is using two pump interfering with each other to match the SAW wavelength and excite it thermoelastically with an aluminum coating on the sample. A CW probe then detects the amplitude in time.
   - ASOPS is a pump-probe scheme, laser beam focused to a much smaller spot so phase matching with the acoustic wave is no longer important, and then 1D scan in both time delay and spatial separation to obtain the space-time diagram, and FFT to bands (omega-k diagram).

# Water Wave Diodes and Waveguide Modes  
Water is the most messed up chemical, and water wave is the most messed up wave. Change my mind.

All the optics and acoustics folks scratching their head trying to make a good, compact & integrated isolator, while you get a water wave isolator (or as they call it: water wave diodes) by making a gradient refractive index waveguide...
 
(Seems like it should be narrow band though, but there's room to improve.)
![20250209_085322_0.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20241101_20250216/20250209_085322_0.jpg)

   - Han2025: [Water wave diodes](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0247624)
   - If I understand it correctly, it works because of water's weird dispersion relation, and you match the incoming wave (background dispersion) to different waveguide modes.
   - Entering from left (n=1) you excite mode 0 and exit with

   - btw if this is the trick (playing with modes) it should not be called an isolator. Maybe that's why they called it a "diode"

   - Look how nice it is to work with a pressure wave (longitudinal polarization only)

This is kind of that but with colloidal nanoparticles on water and shaking with capillary waves.

# Acoustic Levitation of Super-Wavelength Films
Acoustic levitation of a thin film that is larger than the wavelength (40 mm wide vs wavelength of 8.5 mm. Previously all subwavelength droplets and thin films)

They can do 35 ug/mm^2 of lifting with a phased array of 249 transducers, each ~ $1 and ~0.1 W (Corresponding to a thickness of ~ 2 um for gold and 25 um for polymide)

# Curved CMOS Sensors for Improved Optics 
TIL there are companies making curved CMOS imaging sensors to match the shape of the focal surface instead of correcting it with aspherics or additional lens.

(Original paper (?) in 2008, Sony made one in 2014, and there is a French startup Curve-One commercializing it, pictures from them)

   - Found from this recent paper on strain-stress and optoelectronics analysis of curved surface image sensors at 85C vs 20C.

# Optical Tweezers and Photophoretic Trapping 
TIL the opposite of optical tweezers: trapping particles with photophoretic force, which is usually repulsive and much stronger than the scattering/radiation pressure force, and you trap particles at an intensity minimum.

They call it -- the optical bottle beam... tbf this is more like optical tweezers, and the original optical tweezers... idk optical magnet?

   - Here is [another one](https://x.com/jwt0625/status/1826464498313834667) that is a stretch: photonic nanojet, or ballpoint photonic pen...

# Miniaturizing Vision-Based Tactile Sensors with Fiber Optics  
How to make this vision based tactile sensor smaller without shrinking the camera? Use fiber bundles for illumination and imaging!

They called it DIGIT Pinki. It's 15 mm diameter, used a 48-core incoherent plastic optical fiber bundle for the illumination LEDs, and a 7400-core imaging fiber bundle. They got a spatial resolution of ~200 um and force resolution of ~ 5 mN.

# Acoustic Wave Simulations in inhomogeneous media  
[This](https://x.com/jwt0625/status/1889239521839165460) (far field pattern in inhomogeneous media) is a trick question in the sense that far field is ill defined in this scenario where properties of the medium is linear, and that won't be possible for an infinite outer space. But we can still ask how much power is going up or down.

This ray simulation is colored by the elevation angle, and you can see the rays turning from downward to upward.
However, when I check the actual pressure acoustic wave simulation, it radiates downward more, and I'm still thinking about why..

   - Ok I fixed it but I'm not sure at which point, and I can't reproduce the old results anymore lol.
   - The two parameters are weak and strong linear speed & density variation, and last plot is intensity vs y coordinates along an arc of the circular boundary. Downward has lower power

   - The streamlines totally match with the rays as expected, but seeing the actual wave turns just hits different

# Frequency-Domain Simulations for Cherenkov Radiation (did not 100% work)
This radiated wave looks like from a fast moving charge in homogeneous medium, while it's actually a stationary charge in a linearly varying medium, so I played with it a bit more to see if I could change the distribution of refractive index / dielectric constant "properly" to get field equivalent to an actual moving charge.

A frequency domain simulation like this runs much faster than one in time domain with a moving charge. I really wanna see if it's possible to get cherenkov radiation from this.
Here are the results with v = 0.3c, and v = 0.7 c, look kinda working right? And it's broken at v = 0.99c lol.
The refractive index is set such that in simple ray optics picture the rays would look like it's from a moving charge. For v > c, certain regions no longer have a solution for n.

   - Refined the mesh, and reduced the size of the central cutout (needed to avoid the singularity of n distribution), and found this lens effect.. Because n is much higher in this sector.
   - Also ran a bruteforce naive calculation for the same case, for the same v=0.7c, pretty close except for that damn lens effect.
   ![20250213_052248_0.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20241101_20250216/20250213_052248_0.jpg)

   - The issue with v approaching c is, to stop the light from going forward, n needs to be e.g. 100 for v=0.99c, and that would need crazy mesh density to run properly...
   - Also there will be reflection from the central cutout, and the smaller it is the worse it actually gets.
   - Here are v=0.9c, it's losing it lol

   - Maybe I'll figure out the analytic extension for the freq domain sim another day.
