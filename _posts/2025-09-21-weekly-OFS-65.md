# Random Speckle Spectrometers in Photonics

# Filter Design with Multiple Eigenmodes

why do you need more modes to have a better filter?
do you?

   - in this context, modes are refering to the eigenmodes inside a finite space of a wave problem, mostly em waves or acoustic/mechanical waves. Whatever wave it is, it's a linear problem, and you'll have eigen vectors and eigen values. And when the space is finite, the eigen values are discrete.
   - Here are more examples, each line or hairpin supports many modes, and usually only the fundamental one is used in the freq band of interest. Similarly, one optical mode from one ring, and one mechanical mode from each FBAR.
   - In all these cases, more modes are used to get a better filter.
   - So what is a better filter?

   ![20250913_201738_1.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20250214_20250921/20250913_201738_1.jpg)

   - There are still more to talk about modes, like internal loss and coupling to external world (input-output theory & fluctuation-dissipation theorem), potential nonlinearities etc. Let's take a look at what is a good filter.
   - A filter does one thing: it lets some frequencies thru (passband), and rejects other frequencies (stopband). Naturally you get the metrics: how well it pass thru aka insertion loss (IL), how well it stops aka attenuation, and how sharp the transition between the pass and stopband is aka selectivity.
   - there are various other ones such as size, weight and power handling etc.
   - The selectivity is probably the easiest to understand because of the duality of time and frequency: if the device is capable of distinguish two very closely separated frequencies, the wave needs to spend more time in the device.
   - This is why in the AWG example, they needed 9 cm length difference to get 1 ns delay to resolve 1 GHz channels. Similarly, this MZI has a large length diff., plus a large ring resonator coupled to it, to achieve a very sharpe frequency response for laser locking.

   - let's look at some example filter response when we increase the number of modes. Here are some low-pass filters with butterworth and chebyshev type i styles.
   - These are for lumped elements, works well for lower freqs, and you can transform them to transmission line based resonances that are easier to work with at higher freqs, this comsol tutorial model described it very well. The transmission line LPF chip above was a maximally flat N = 3 LPF at around 2.5 GHz.
   - ( first two plots made by claude, 3rd one from [Fast Modeling of a Transmission Line Low-Pass Filter](https://comsol.com/model/fast-modeling-of-a-transmission-line-low-pass-filter-41681) )

   - claude pretty much knows coupled mode theory and input-output theory now. Here is how you could get a better and better bandpass filter with more modes, and at some point these coupled modes will remind you of solid state physics and how bands are formed.
   - ( reflection only shown for dB plot so that it's less messy )
   - If you build a bruteforce sim (fig. 2, N = 3, coupled transmission line), you'll find it matching the simple theory quite well.

   ![BPF-comsol](/assets/images/2025/20250214_20250921/BPF-comsol.png)
   - i got good news for you if you design SAW/BAW/FBAR filters (fig. 3 in the original post), claude is not good at ladder filter / BVD model at all, took quite some back and forth.
   - this is a bit less straightforward to explain, as the filter bandwidth is determined by the piezoelectric k^2, which is kind of similar to the coupling rate in the coupled mode BPF case. The general behavior of more modes -> sharper transition & better isolation still applies.
   ![ladder-BVD-1](/assets/images/2025/20250214_20250921/ladder-BVD-1.png)
   ![ladder-BVD-2](/assets/images/2025/20250214_20250921/ladder-BVD-2.png)
   ![ladder-BVD-3](/assets/images/2025/20250214_20250921/ladder-BVD-3.png)
   - so can you get a sharp response *AND* a wider bandwidth with fewer modes?
   - I do not have a clean explanation yet, but I have made up a "filter quality factor Q_f" defined as (passband width)/(transition width). Note this is different from Q factor of a mode. And the above observations are number of modes needed N_mode >~ Q_f.
   - We'll need to go back to what is a mode, and what does it mean when we couple to a mode. Maybe I'll continue after i get some sleep..

   - it's a pretty bad electro-optic / piezo-optomechanical modulator, only few hundred MHz shift from 20 Vpp. But optical Q is high.

Procrastinating:
- Droplet walker
- Low cost robot arm
- Joystick doomscrolling


Planning:
- Writing:
   - cleanroom misc
- Wave demo with ~ 300 Hz water surface wave + 3D printed components
- One-click web paper publishing: every time i see a pay walled paper i get pissed off. I should build something to help people publish their paper as their own website.


Ongoing:
- Playground:
   - week 65: Added more analysis to [bay bridge traffic](https://github.com/jwt625/bay-bridge-traffic-cam)
      - should really continue one-click-paper-page!
   - week 63:
      - Continuing [one click web paper](https://github.com/jwt625/PlayGround/tree/main/20250831_one_click_paper_page). Got actual deployment working. Had to refactor backend etc.
      - Also added traffic speed to [Bay Bridge traffic](https://bay-bridge-traffic.com). The repo was spun off from PlayGround last weekend iirc.
      ![BBT-speed](/assets/images/2025/BBT-speed.png)
   - week 62: [one click web paper](https://github.com/jwt625/PlayGround/tree/main/20250831_one_click_paper_page)
      - ![One-click-paper](/assets/images/2025/20240926_20250811/one-click-paper.png)
      - took half a day to figure out a token scope problem...
   - week 60: [scraping youtube liked video](https://github.com/jwt625/PlayGround/tree/main/20250816_youtube_liked)
   - week 59: "deployed" theBay Bridge traffic monitoring
      - inaccurate, unstable, and no guarantee on QoS, but anyway it is at bay-bridge-traffic dot com
      - ![BBT-dashbpard](/assets/images/2025/20240926_20250811/BBT-20250810.png)
      - https://bay-bridge-traffic.com
      - I think it is already getting hit hard and slowing down the detection, might have to take this down
      - nope not really getting hit hard, not sure what it was, added some rate limiting and restarted things, now back to 30 fps most of the time
   - week 58: Bay bridge traffic tracker
      - [tweet](https://x.com/jwt0625/status/1952093334476095643)
