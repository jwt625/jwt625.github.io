1. Microwaving grapes touching each other could generate plasma, and it still works after shrinking both the grape and the microwave by ~10000x. If you have a fs laser, you can use this effect to cut a trench that is almost 100x smaller than the laser wavelength.

2. oomf pointed me to Hadron-Calorimeter (HCAL) from Jefferson Lab, and they have amazing details of light guide design, manufacturing, and testing, including how and why they choose the methods for cutting, bending, and polishing etc., to reduce man-hour for making 24,000 of them.

4. If you are into electronics (and photonics etc.) packaging, IEEE has an Elecronics Packaging Society, and you can read and watch slides and videos from past technical meetings, like how to make good glass by corning, quantum computing, photonic wirebonds, and x-ray imaging etc.

5. Stretchable antenna is a thing, for both single antennas and phased arrays. Could be used for remote strain sensing, antenna frequency tuning, integrating with other flexible electronics etc.

6. I ran into a paper using a "Brazil-nut-sandwitch" setup, and made me wonder why it's called that. Turns out it is more commonly refered to as Brazilian test, and originated from a Brazilian civil engineer trying to move a church with concrete rollers instead of steel.

7. I had no idea LEDs now can be made subwavelength size. Their motivation is for structured illumination, but all I could think about is how to make them coherent and into a phased array.
They also have insane current and power density, a few kA/cm^2 & kW/cm^2, that's x1e4 sunlight

   - [Directly addressable GaN-based nano-LED arrays: fabrication and electro-optical characterization](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41378-020-00198-y)
   - Found this paper through a recent review paper on microLED: [MicroLED arrays—A perspective beyond displays](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/125/15/150504/3316405/MicroLED-arrays-A-perspective-beyond-displays)
   - The nanoLED paper also used an interesting technique, because the LEDs are too small for optical microscope. It is called electron beam induced current (EBIC). It's fascinating how efficient a single high eV electron could get converted to many low eV ones: [EBIC - A Valuable Tool for Semiconductor Evaluation and Failure Analysis](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4208160)

   - The nanoLED also reminded me of Chu's limit on gain and bandwidth of small and passive antennas. Worth a read if you work with antennas. [Physical Limitations of Omni‐Directional Antennas](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-abstract/19/12/1163/159051/Physical-Limitations-of-Omni-Directional-Antennas?redirectedFrom=fulltext) (also a [free version with horrible format](https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/4984/RLE-TR-064-04706975.pdf).)

   - Isn't it more related to bandgap size than the size of the components? In principle yes. In practice making the pixels separately addressable is harder when it gets smaller, and they have to change the growth process to make things thinner for etching and refilling. Transfering from sapphire to cmos is another thing that that paper did not address.

8. My whole life has been a lie. Microwave oven is not hitting any water resonances.
(gf heated up honey melon with microwave so I was thinking about if we could do sideband cooling on water so that I don't need to wait for it to cooldown in the fridge. It does have resonances in IR)
![20241013_042232_0.jpg](/assets/images/2024/20240707_20241017/20241013_042232_0.jpg)

   - Clarification: it is still lossy (absorbs the microwave), it is just there is no resonance.
i.e., you could totally make a microwave oven at 500 MHz or 10 GHz to make it bigger and heat up more food at the same time, or more portable.
   ![20241013_043549_0.jpg](/assets/images/2024/20240707_20241017/20241013_043549_0.jpg)

   - In hindsight this is more obvious, vibrational and rotational modes are in THz to IR. Lower frequency dissipations should be "rigid body" motion of the water molecule.
There is still a way, if I keep my food under E field ~GV/m, it should cool from adiabatic depolarization lol.
   ![20241013_043549_2.jpg](/assets/images/2024/20240707_20241017/20241013_043549_2.jpg)
   - Rotational modes are in the IR (2~4 um, in the last figure above). At GHz (~ 0.1 cm^-1), it looks very smooth.
   ![20241013_043004_0.jpg](/assets/images/2024/20240707_20241017/20241013_043004_0.jpg)
   - From this table here I'm getting penetration depth L = lambda/(4pi k) ~ 16 cm, not bad

9. Adiabatic depolarization is totally doable for ceramics that are ~1000x more polarizable than water. A multilayer ceramic capacitor (MLCC) with ~10 um layers only need ~100 V.
This is called electrocaloric cooling, and recent papers have showed T diff of 13 C and heat flux of ~100 mW/cm^2.

   - I used to be confused about how they cycle the heat out. They showed you can do it mechanically, moving heat along a chain of MLCC (fig. 1-3), or use fluid (fig. 4)

10. The power-over-skin (see below) reminds me of this paper where they made a whole room into a ~1 MHz resonator for wireless charging, receivers with ~50% efficiency, safe for human ~> 100 W input power, and showed a furnished room with wirelessly powered lamp, fan, and phone charger.
What can I say, I want both!

12. July 6, 2024: I remember seeing similar work (a system of deformable active cell mimics & observed a reentrant jamming transition mediated by cell shape changes, or a small robot swam dynamics) in PRL (group of mech mice pushing a boundary around), can't find it...
   - Oct 16, 2024: I found a very similar one! It was in science robotics not PRL. It's almost the same as I remembered, maybe my memory was wrong.

13. I just got my magnetic flux viewing film today, and the color looks amazing, although it changes with lighting a bit.
It uses MTX (magnetically color-tunable photonic crystal material) or magnetic multi-granule nanoclusters (MGNCs) from Nanobrick, and the product is called MX-Film.
