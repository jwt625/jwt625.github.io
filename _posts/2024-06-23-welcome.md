Many aspects of this blog is still under construction. If you are interested, come back later (maybe a week or two). You can checkout the [About]({{ "/about/" | relative_url }}) page for now.

I kept the example posts since I'm still learning [this template](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes). They are all in 2010 and you could ignore those.

# TODO
- [x] finish the About page
- [] start collecting the outside five sigma stuff I find into a weekly post
- [] write up about the shed build
- [] write up the Sep 2023 road trip (drove a big loop around west coast, 6000 miles in four weeks)
- [] write up the Blender projects during PhD

# Projects in planning
- combining [SAM](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) and [SLAM](https://github.com/UZ-SLAMLab/ORB_SLAM3) for tracking where all my shits are
  - build glasses with [OpenGlass](https://github.com/BasedHardware/OpenGlass)
