1. A group of researcher showed you can use piezoelectric effect of ceramic capacitors to excite acoustic modes of the monitor and use it to send out signal covertly.
- Paper: [PIXHELL Attack: Leaking Sensitive Information from Air-Gap Computers via `Singing Pixels'](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04930)

2. Cherenkov radiation can be used to identify different charged particles with known momentum because they radiate into different directions (Ring-imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detector). Those photon hits an electron out of a cathode, accel by 20 kV, then hit silicon detector array

4. There is a name for academics hoarding & guarding resources, and suppress others: the Gollum Effect

5. If you got \[REDACTED\]+\[REDACTED\] or so a year to spare, you can get your layout level photonic circuit performance simulated on a single platform using device/component level sim with Tidy3D and circuit level sim with IPKISS.

6. Ultrasound makes bending easier just like in ultrasonic wirebonding, and you benefit more than the average because of nonlinearities. You could even further "cheat" with acoustic resonances.
- Paper: [Effect of high-power ultrasonic vibration on the flexible bending process of thin-walled circular tubes: Numerical and experimental research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0041624X2300135X?via%3Dihub)

![ultrasonic_assisted_bending_2.jpeg](/assets/images/2024/ultrasonic_assisted_bending_2.jpeg)
- The term for this is ultrasonic-assisted flexible bending (UAFB), or more generally acoustic softening. It's been intensely studied in various materials for the reason you could see below. Some 30 W/cm^2 ultrasonic power is better at softening zinc than heating it to 250 C.
![ultrasonic_assisted_bending_3.jpeg](/assets/images/2024/ultrasonic_assisted_bending_3.png)
![ultrasonic_assisted_bending_4.jpeg](/assets/images/2024/ultrasonic_assisted_bending_4.png)
- Similar plots in the wirebonding book (George Harman, Wire Bonding in Microelectronics). For aluminum you get equivalence of 600C with 50 W/cm^2, a power level you could roughly get with 50 bucks.

7. I've always thought ebeam litho as moving a single pixel around. Turns out there is a whole branch of shaped beam ones, this is one of them: reflective electron beam lithography (REBL). An array of small metallic pixels shape the beam reflectively, just like DMD but for electrons
- [Direct write electron beam lithography: a historical overview](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/7823/782316/Direct-write-electron-beam-lithography-a-historical-overview/10.1117/12.868477.short#_=_)
- [REBL: A novel approach to high speed maskless electron beam direct write lithography](https://pubs.aip.org/avs/jvb/article-abstract/27/1/161/467317/REBL-A-novel-approach-to-high-speed-maskless)
![REBL_1.jpeg](/assets/images/2024/REBL_1.jpeg)
![REBL_2.jpeg](/assets/images/2024/REBL_2.jpeg)
- Now how do you reflect a few tens kV of electrons?? They are first decelerated by the electron optics before the DPG, and then he DPG only needs a few volts to either repel or capture the electrons. In a newer paper they showed SEMs of the DPG chip with lenslets on top of CMOS.

- From KLA-tencor: [REBL: design progress toward 16 nm half-pitch maskless projection electron beam lithography](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/8323/832311/REBL--design-progress-toward-16-nm-half-pitch-maskless/10.1117/12.919744.short), supported by DARPA MTO with $30M in 2010. See [2010 DARPA funding list](https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/FOID/Reading%20Room/Science_and_Technology/12-F-1039_2010-DARPA-Funding-List.pdf)
- From 1975 to 1995, the pixel rate of ebeam direct write increased from 2e7 to 2e9, however wafer size ~4x and feature size shrinked ~10x, increasing the number of pixels by 1e3. Without massively parallel projection it would be < 0.1 wph. Now 20 years later, we are still on 12in.

8. In addition to high power LED headlights we all love, cars might get integrated holographic camera modules (IHCM). They could show you "robots, animals, cartoon characters, celebrities", as well as the car itself, with overlapping range and tracking to make sure you always see it.

10. Let me introduce you Yokogawa minimal Fab, when everyone is going larger wafers & higher throughput, they make 0.5 in wafer tools all in one form factor, with almost all front-end capabilities, that does NOT need to be in a clean room.

11. You can drill with microwave. It uses an extendable monopole antenna as the drill bit, the surface near it gets heat up the most, and also gets to absorb the microwave better. They can use a 1 kW at 2.45 GHz, common for a commercial microwave, to drill concrete holes of 2 mm diameter and 2 cm deep in less than one minute.

12. The activity of neurons associated with motor preparation decrease as stakes get too high. (Motor preparation = making calculations about how to complete a movement) “You just don't perform better as the reward increases”. Find the optimal for you and shoot for that.

13. Now some thermal camerasa are only a few hundred bucks and could do 25 Hz, lock-in thermography should be possible with those? You could getting more than 100x better temperature resolution with decent wait time (~ 1000 s).
