# Traveling-wave parametric amplifiers

This blog is about traveling-wave parametric amplifiers, how do they work, and how to tune them.

i asked your beloved sota LLM "how do i tune a JTWPA? give me a step by step guide, as well as list of things i need, and list of things to be careful about", and the answer is honestly quite decent, go ahead try it yourself. what i could offer, are some refs i like, some real world examples, and hopefully also trigger some real experts to tell you what i'm wrong about.

maybe i'll also talk about optical parametric amplifiers, or maybe i could convince my expert friends to talk about them instead of me..

#  Why do we need amplifiers?

where should we start? maybe we should start with why do we need amplifiers.

I once heard an anecdote from my advisor that he got into a fight at an old school microwave conference talking about measurement in a dilfridge, because people do not believe you can measure S11 of your device in a dilfridge, where you have ~60 dB or even higher attenuation on your input lines to kill the noise from room temperature. As a result, naively you'd get 120+ dB total attenuation roundtrip. luckily there is a type of component called circulators (interesting topic worth its own thread but not here), and you can use a different path out, and you can amplify the signal back so that your crappy classical electronic instruments at room temperature could detect what would otherwise be single quanta level attenuated further. 


In the following typical dilfridge setup, you can see a series of attenuators on the way down, the device under test (DUT), a circulator, and two amplifiers (and some isolators) on the way up. There are more amplifiers and filters after the signal gets out of the fridge, and then digitized if you are rich, or mixed down, filtered, and then digitized. The first amplifier is the most important one, since its noise will be amplified by all subsequent amplifiers. This is why there are a lot of effort into making good near-quantum-limited amplifiers, and TWPAs are some of the best ones.

## What is a good amplifier?

now, what is a good amplifier, and what does quantum limited amplifier mean? you also mentioned mixer, don't you feel like you should explain what a mixer is? Thankfully mixers are kind of related to amplifiers. A good amplifier is easy to define, you give me a signal, and I give you G times that signal, ideally, and G is the gain of the amplifier. The signal could have different frequencies and powers, so you'd want the amplifier to be broadband, and have high saturation power, that's a good amplifier. But there is one more thing, amplifers always add noise, so you also want the added noise to be as low as possible. Why do they always add noise? do they really have to? 
   

The answer, in principle, is actually it depends. (in practice there will always be noise added no matter what you do, tiny insertion loss on the connector? I'm sorry that is a beam splitter, and thermal noise gets added) And to answer it, some quantum jibberish is inevitable. The fastest way to arrive at the intuition, is to admit the fact that your signals are eelctromagnetic waves, and em waves follow similar rules as a simple harmonic oscillator in quantum mechanics.

When you amplify the wave, you are multiplying the operators. If nothing else is added, you'll break the commutation relation of the operators, and the quantum mechanics god says, nope, you'll get at least vacuum noise added (figure 1 & 2). If an amplifier's added noise is very low single digit number of photons, people usually start calling them near quantum limited.
- (it's hard to say about just one amplifier, so you'll also see people talk about the system noise, and compare it to the quantum limit) 

   ![20251115_081446_0.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20241227_20251117/20251115_081446_0.jpg)

Then why did i say it actually depends? That is because some amplifiers could treat different quadratures differently, and they are amplely named phase-sensitive amplifiers. One common form of them amplify one quadrature and attenuate the other one, so you'll need to know your signal for it to work well, and it will also squeeze the noise on your signal. Figure 3 shows how different kinds of noise could be visualized on top of your signal, two of them are squeezed noise (b and c). 
- ref: Caves1982: [Quantum limits on noise in linear amplifiers]( https://painterlab.caltech.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/qe_caves_limits_amplifiers.pdf) 
- (how to quantize an em field is another interesting topic that i won't be able to do it justice here, and an over-simplified way of describing the process is: at any and every point in space-time, you can create or kill a photon, and thus you could "assemble" your em field with a sum of these photon creation operators weighted by the spatial-temporal form of your wave)

## Mixers vs Parametric amplifiers

move on to mixers, and why mixers are kind of related to parametric amplifiers? marki microwave has a nice primer on mixers, and here is the first figure from it, versus one figure from Malnou2021. There are three waves involved in both cases, LO, RF, and IF for the mixer, and pump, signal, and idler for the parametric amplifier. Both processes get the name three-wave mixing because of this, and they both use the same 2nd order nonlinearity as the dominant effect. 

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; gap: 10px; margin: 20px 0;">

So, can you pump a mixer real hard to get amplification? Of course (if the nonlinear element is not dissipative)! Many parametric amplifiers in the 1960s are pumping a varactor, which could also work as a mixer. I'm not so familiar with these classics, so here goes the refs if you'd like to know more:

# Josephson parametric amplifiers (JPAs)

## Why do we need Josephson junctions (JJs)?


the usual diodes and varactors offer you the nonlinearity for mixing and amplification, however, it's a bit too weak for quantum stuff. Thankfully, there are a group of folks who also deal with very weak signals all the time: astronomers.

Paul Seidel's Applied Superconductivity has a chapter on josephson junction based mixers, or superconductor–insulator–superconductor(SIS) mixers, written by and with plenty of references from astronomers. As they said, an SIS junction gives you one of the cleanest (non dissipative) and strongest nonlinearity, and thus a best fit for low noise mixers and amplifiers.
(i also just want you to see their amazing mixers)

</div>



it is kind of hard to intuitively understand why JJs have such "strong" nonlinearity. One way to look at it is by looking at the energy of one microwave photon say around 5 GHz, which would be just few ueV. As a result, the material need to change properties from such low energy/field strength, or have distinct states separated by similarly small energy scale. The superconducting energy gap is such an example of an energy scale much smaller than the rest of the system, and some few electron quantum dots on graphene or 2DEG also have similar small energy scales. However, the charge coherence time of them are too weak, thus the nonlinearity is dissipative, and they lose to JJs for making good mixers and amplifiers.

I'll also shamelessly plug my blog on SC qubits here, where you can find more on JJs: [How to Superconducting Qubits – Part I](https://outside5sigma.com/tutorial/20250619-sc-qubits-intro/)


## Using JJs for parametric amplification

since josephson junction is already a thing in the 1960s, when did people start trying it out for parametric amplification? Not that much later: in the 1970s.

here is one example from Berkeley in 1974 (figure 1 & 2), with 12 dB amplification measured before they came up with an theory for it one year later. The setup was mostly at roomT, with the JJ arrays plus some impedance matching elements packaged and dunked in liquid helium. It's so early the JJs are still called Anderson‐Dayem microbridges.
(the name Josephson tunnel junctions were also used in other cases)
- Parrish1974: [Amplification of microwaves by superconducting microbridges in a four‐wave parametric mode](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.1655337)

Very soon we'll see follow up work with higher gain and lower pump power, as well as eventually squeezing of the noise in late 1980s (figure 3 & 4, squeezing is mentioned earlier in this thread for phase sensitive amplifiers). You can see the cryogenic setup is getting more mature, the probe signal is sent in via a 40 dB coupler at 4 K, and multiple circulators used at the output. They clearly saw phase dependent gain/squeezing, which you'll find similar ones from various squeezing work across microwave and optical.
- Yurke1989: [Observation of 4.2-K equilibrium-noise squeezing via a Josephson-parametric amplifier](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.60.764)

</div>


a few fun things to notice during this era, some folks from the above two papers also worked with optics a lot, e.g. RY Chiao is a student of CH Townes who's behind masers and lasers, and Bernard Yurke on a lot of nonlinear optics works such as optical squeezing with four wave mixing. All waves are similar.
also during the 1980s, also at Berkeley, Michel Devoret and John Martinis showed superconducting circuits are macroscopically quantum, setting it up for a good run of circuit QED starting from 1990s and still going.




## Evolution of JPAs

so what is the difference between the josephson parametric amplifiers (JPAs) in the 1980s and 2010s? and when are you gonna finally start talking about JTWPAs?

Well they are largely the same, here is a JPA from 2015, looks very similar even to the PAs from the 1960s right? Because it is just a good nonlinear element, plus impedance matching, and maybe even some frequency multiplexing or filters were also included on the chip.
However, designing them properly is not straightforward (i have a cheatsheet that evolved into 6 pages, i should put it on my blog..), not to mention broadband operation, that's where JTWPA really shines (tho still need tuning).
- Roy2016: [Broadband parametric amplification with impedance engineering: Beyond the gain-bandwidth product](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.03065)
![G5008D0bkAA85J0.jpeg](/assets/images/2025/JTWPA/G5008D0bkAA85J0.jpeg)


In addition, you'll also find fancy new arrangements of junctions, or different ways of impedance matching such as using resonators. The fab process is also getting better as folks push up the coherence time of superconducting qubits, while the same groups of folks were making JPAs for qubits readout.
Abdo2011: [Josephson amplifier for qubit readout](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.3653473) (they made both the signal and the idler freqs to have resonant modes in the circuit)
![G504M3mbkAQAn9p.jpeg](/assets/images/2025/JTWPA/G504M3mbkAQAn9p.jpeg)


On the other hand, people's mindset has also been shifting from transport measurement focused (like how the original AC josephson effect was done) to more RF/microwave first. This shows up both in the design of the circuits, as well as the design of the measurement setup. Less bias lines, if any they'd be properly and strongly filtered. More attenuators and filters on the input lines, and more circulators and isolators on the readout lines. HEMTs based low noise amplifiers (albeit far from quantum limited) were starting to get used at 4 K.
- Aumentado2020: [Superconducting Parametric Amplifiers: The State of the Art in Josephson Parametric Amplifiers](https://doi.org/10.1109/MMM.2020.2993476) (pretty good review with pretty pictures)
![G504OPYbkAM9Opf.jpeg](/assets/images/2025/JTWPA/G504OPYbkAM9Opf.jpeg)


(here are some interesting JJ arrangements: SNAIL (superconducting nonlinear asymmetric inductive element), ATS (Asymmetrically Threaded SQUID ). They in general offer more flexibilities of the nonlinear terms from the JJs, but also requires more dedicated flux bias. In addition, you could also add parametric modulation, to "decrease" the order of nonlinearity, a common trick appilcable to all kinds of nonlinearities in different systems. )

## Bandwidth, and why traveling wave

if you have looked at a few resonant JPAs, you will notice their bandwidth is a few tens of MHz, and rarely few hundred MHz. It is partly because of the impedance matching relying on the resonances, and i also would like to think about it as how much time the waves get to spend with the nonlinear gain medium.
(see two figures of gain curves from JPAs cited in the post above)

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; gap: 10px; margin: 20px 0;">
  <img src="/assets/images/2025/JTWPA/G52lZX-bkAY4Xde.jpeg" alt="G52lZX-bkAY4Xde.jpeg" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
  <img src="/assets/images/2025/JTWPA/G52leGraQAAJloC.jpeg" alt="G52leGraQAAJloC.jpeg" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>



This "time spent" argument is less clear than how I used it in my thread about filter performance, where things are linear and the time-freq duality is more rigorous.
Nonlinearity complicates a lot of things, but good news is that the pump is usually treated as classical and moved out of the quantum picture, and things become linear again, and you'll find you gotta spend more time to make the signal grow exponentially more. I'm gonna cheat and grab the result for you, which you just need to notice the cosh and sinh terms, they are exponentials, and they got time t inside.
Louisell1961: [Quantum Fluctuations and Noise in Parametric Processes. I.](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRev.124.1646) (these are easily derived from the interaction hamiltonian, do it yourself or ask chatGPT/grok to show you how)
![G52lfD4bAAA4YM8.png](/assets/images/2025/JTWPA/G52lfD4bAAA4YM8.png)


as a result, if you work with single or few modes, the way to make the wave spend more time in your PA is to make the mode higher Q, and thus narrower bandwidth. To increase bandwidth, we need more modes, and the ultimate form of a lot of modes is a delay line, or a waveguide. We need a nonlinear waveguide.
I can't resist but also to mention that the same principle applies to old amplifiers as well, klystrons have two resonant cavities, and is narrowband (few tens of MHz) unless you tune them or add more cavities. On the other hand, Traveling-Wave Tubes (TWTs) easily gives you GHz bandwidth.


## Phase matching in JTWPA


if some process happens in time long enough, energy has to be conserved to the corresponding degree. Similarly if some process happens in space long enough, momentum conservation or phase matching condition has to be met, or efficiency of it sucks.
you'll solve a very similar equation as the time domain case in the post above, this time with the evolution in space with coordinate x. If the phase mismatch dk is finite, you start getting sinusoidal oscillations once the wave propagates longer than 1/dk.
- O’Brien2014: [Resonant Phase Matching of Josephson Junction Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifiers](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.113.157001)
- (i used dk for short for \Delta k)

![G52qN60bsAA7r_4.png](/assets/images/2025/JTWPA/G52qN60bsAA7r_4.png)

- (not enough budget to get to a proper definition for phase matching, but you could imagine it as running on a conveyor belt to try to catch a plane that is taking off, sum of your speed and the conveyor belt has to match the speed of the plane)
- of course PK Tien has an old (from 1958) classic on [Parametric Amplification and Frequency Mixing in Propagating Circuits](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.1723440), with nice visual on how energy is shuffling back and forth in different scenarios of three wave mixing.
![G52vwDUbYAAgYtb.png](/assets/images/2025/JTWPA/G52vwDUbYAAgYtb.png)


Phase matching is especially important in nonlinear optics since the nonlinearity is weak, and it takes more time and distance for the process to be efficient, meanwhile the modes are less confined and look really different at different frequencies in the waveguide, i.e., the bands are less straight, aka more dispersive (disperse = waves at different freq move at different speed).

For microwave circuits, the dispersion of the waveguide itself is little, until we start adding nonlinearity to it. The nonlinearity has undesired byproducts called self and cross phase modulation (SPM and XPM), or plainly put, power of the pump affects the wave speed of the pump itself, as well as the signal and idler. As a result, this also leads to phase mismatch that is dependent on the pump power.
- asked claude to generate this toy visualization for phase mismatch from SPM and XPM
![dispersion_animation.gif](/assets/images/2025/JTWPA/dispersion_animation.gif)

There is a few ways to compensate for the phase mismatch. In nonlinear optics, you can flip the crystal domains with poling at the periodicity that corresponds to the phase mismatch dk. In TWPAs, you can modulate the shape of the waveguide like this example, where you can see the width of the spiral waveguide has a slow periodic variation. You can also add frequency selective dispersion to the waveguide, i.e., a resonance inside the waveguide aka resonant phase matching. By parking the pump frequency at different points on the dispersion feature from the resonance, you can phase match to different pump powers.

![G52yodgakAA_qaR.png](/assets/images/2025/JTWPA/G52yodgakAA_qaR.png)



## Resonant phase matching

finally time to talk about the resonant phase matched JTWPA from MIT RLE/Lincoln lab and Berkeley/LBNL, which you will find in many later paper's acknowledgement:
- Macklin2015: [A near–quantum-limited Josephson traveling-wave parametric amplifier](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa8525)
![G52zbFiakAA9i0V.png](/assets/images/2025/JTWPA/G52zbFiakAA9i0V.png)


There are a lot of details in the paper as well as in the SI. You'll find SOTA cryogenic setup common in many SC qubit papers, maybe only not as heavily filtered for IR thermal photons. The resonant phase matching LC resonators are using parallel plate with PECVD oxide because of the small footprint required, and the loss tangent of it limits the passive insertion loss.

![G57f_YMaMAIu__O.jpeg](/assets/images/2025/JTWPA/G57f_YMaMAIu__O.jpeg)



Nevertheless, the gain curve is beautiful, and spans so many GHz that finding a good isolator/circulator becomes a headache. Backreflections need to be minimized to avoid oscillation. In practice, there will always be some reflections somewhere, causing the ripples in the gain spectrum, which get worse at higher pump power/higher gain.

System noise is only ~2x of the minimum allowed by quantum mechanics, truely near–quantum-limited.
P1dB is "only" -99 dBm, which will motivate future kinetic inductance based TWPAs for higher power handling.


# Tuning a JTWPA

here is how a packaged JTWPA looks like (cryoperm shield removed), very simple looking device with two ports. A directional coupler also visible for coupling in the pump.

Since the JJs are along the signal trace, be extremely careful with ESD. Keep things capped and shorted as much as you can, discharge yourself and ground yourself. I've even heard gloves are not recommended since it is insulating too much, and you just gotta wash your hands. (i don't remember anymore if followed this no-glove recommendation or not..)

## Simple VNA measurements




Starting with simple linear S21 tests, the dispersion feature is clearly visible. Circulator was 4-8 Ghz, hence spectrum looked wacky outside of its range. This is inside the fridge and cooled down, so the drop in frequency is partly because of the dielectric loss.

- (this is raw data so cable loss etc is also included)
- (4K HEMT and room T LNAs are on and added back some of the attenuations on the way down.)

Seems like nothing is wrong, and time to send in some pump power. These are also raw power at the signal generator, and the actual pump power on the JTWP is much lower. Same S21 curve is measured using the probe path, and calibrated to the no pump S21 to show the gain.

One thing to be careful about here is the pump could saturate the room T LNA if you have too many/too much gain on them.

## Pump optimization

next is optimizing the pump for best gain. Theres not that many degrees of freedom, just frequency and power, so you could start with a frequency sweep of the pump, measure the gain as usual, and they look like this, for a wide and narrow range of pump freq sweep. Color bar is gain in dB.

After you are settled with a pump frequency (e.g. it gives the highest gain at the signal freq you are interested in), you can do a pump power sweep. Here are two examples where i started conservatively, and then a finer sweep ending with higher power. There's clearly an optimal pump power, after which the gain gets demolished. There is always something in reality that limits the gain, and what's worse is you could get unwanted oscillations even before actual gain saturation.

## Signal generator + spectrum analyzer measurements

all the above measurements are done with a VNA, it's convenient and quick, but VNA is kind of horrible for characterizing nonlinear components. It's not a clean rf source, and it only looks at one frequency for the output. You really want a proper signal generator (SG), and a spectrum analyzer (SA): 

here is an example of various noise floors (y axis is dBm/Hz), red is the SA noise floor, green is with room T LNA on, blue is LNA + HEMT, and black is LNA + HEMT + JTWPA. I probably did not pump it hard enough, becuase you'd always want the noise floor to be dominated by the first and best amplifier (which gets amplified by all subsequent amplifiers). next is to repeat the above tuning and optimization with SG and SA. A probe of 4 GHz is used, that's the peak at the center. There are also other peaks and sidebands moving around, almost like they are welcoming you to the nonlinear world. The FSR of these sidebands are (some of) the standing wave modes of the whole JTWPA, and the FSR shrinks as the wave gets slower with higher pump power.

It's even more fun when sweeping the pump freq and looking at a wider range of the spectrum. Does this remind you of something? yeah, mode locked lasers/solitons, and you could change the pump freq and get all kinds of wacky spectrum just like some of the optical solitons. however, i did not measure any time domain proof that the sidebands are actually coherent.

lastly, some raw data of a really weak signal with TWPA off (blue) and on (yellow), look at that rising noise floor, and the sweet gain on the actual signal. If you know what the signal should be, you can convert everything to input-referred, and get a calibrated plot like the one in the 2015 JTWPA paper.

last lastly, i would like to highlight some recent development, especially on kinetic inductance based TWPA (two of the four pretty pictures in the OP), and an integrated isolator with TWPA-like nonlinear waveguide (with SNAILs). The KI based TWPA is easier to make (single layer e.g. NbTiN), and easier to operate with three-wave mixing by adding a bias current. It also has much higher P1dB, >30 higher than JTWPAs.

And this isolator work is really new, not that many people are trying to solve the problem of isolators taking too much space & need to be made onto a chip, not to mention one with broad bandwidth. This one is probably annoying to operate, but exciting new way of making an on-chip isolator.

# General references
   - i learnt cQED by reading Dave's thesis [Circuit Quantum Electrodynamics]( https://schusterlab.stanford.edu/static/pdfs/Schuster_thesis.pdf), this is a must read. There are many more recent reviews if you prefer up to date stuff. 
   - I really learnt how to design various circuits with JJs after Marek's thesis [Microwave photonics in superconducting circuits]( https://doi.org/10.3929/ethz-a-010735338), especially Appendix C: A shortcut to circuit quantization. (there are many reviews on design and black box quantization as well) 
   - i flipped through refs in this review and i think you might be better off reading it instead of this thread for history developments and prior arts: Aumentado2020: [Superconducting Parametric Amplifiers: The State of the Art in Josephson Parametric Amplifiers]( https://doi.org/10.1109/MMM.2020.2993476)
   - good luck have fun!
