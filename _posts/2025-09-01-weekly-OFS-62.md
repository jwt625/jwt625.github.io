# Aerodynamic mechanisms in migratory bird formations

Glad to see people study "coherent phased array" of birds. They showed the best separation is one wavelength for in-phase flight, and 1.25x wavelength for antiphase.

(wavelength is distance traveled by the bird during one wingbeat cycle)

# Superconducting qubit coherence improvement techniques

i've wanted to open one, never did, and just ran into someone who did, and they actually cooled them down without the cover lol

(it's probably cooled down as is most of the time, i've seen it, but who knows how long it's going to take to find that.. this is from Yale in ~ 2012)

# Photonic links for distributed RF antenna arrays

why run rf cables if you could run fibers?

(and afford the modulators, detectors, and amplifiers)

   - we had an emi room at my grad school labs supposedly for sensitive rf measurements, and the most use i had with it were detecting weak optical sidebands without rf crosstalk. I'd put detectors amplifiers and spectrum analyzer in the room, and run fibers from my setup outside into


# Quantum RF design kit development

have you suffered getting qiskit to actually run?
(it took claude and I more than 2 h to set it up in a container because of old dependencies)

I have good news for you, gdsfactory is starting a QPDK that's setup with uv, all tests pass out of the box, and it already got a decent library of basic components.

(this is not sponsored, I'm just a fan of gdsfactory, and warning this is still very early. Component showcase gds generated by claude.)

      - I think it is already getting hit hard and slowing down the detection, might have to take this down
      - nope not really getting hit hard, not sure what it was, added some rate limiting and restarted things, now back to 30 fps most of the time
   - week 58: Bay bridge traffic tracker
