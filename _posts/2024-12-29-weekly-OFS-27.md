1. Remember the TPP 3D printed microrobots? They trap an air bubble inside, and pump fluid & move around when acoustically driven at its resonance.
- Now there is a newer version of it they call bioresorbable acoustic microrobot (BAM), that has 30 um diameter, similar propulsion capability, steerable with magnetic fields, and can be imaged & guided with ultrasound imaging, and they actually did it in vivo in the bladder of a mouse.
- (TPP: two-photon polymerization)

2. University of Michigan has a [Visual Encyclopedia of Chemical Engineering Equipment](https://encyclopedia.che.engin.umich.edu).
It "has been developed over the past 20 years to help you learn how chemical engineering equipment works. You’ll find descriptions of many different industrial processes and more than 100 kinds of equipment used in industry."

   - Found it because I was looking up fiber spinning.
   - Which is because of this paper on using a jet to assist the fiber spinning in a liquid bath.

4. This "747 flying two sheets of paper away from grass, and being able to read about each one of them" analogy of HDD blew my mind. That is few nm gap between the head and the platter, ~width of a single strand of DNA.
- Recently I heard from a friend that HDDs are filled with helium. Turns out It's been done as early as in the 1950s for the drum memory, in commercial HDDs for more than 10 years, and "as of March 2020, Helium is used in all high-capacity drives for data-centers. These come from all of the three remaining HDD manufacturers: Western Digital, Seagate, and Toshiba."
- Helium is much lighter, lower drag, and more laminar than air. It reduces turbulence and random forces on the disks and arms, less acoustic noise, and better thermalization and temperature distribution. However, sealing it is a big hustle. People have tried various ways, and settled with laser welding.

5. TIL ultrasonic vibration is also used to make blade dicing cleaner and faster. I've done 0.5~2 mm/s feed speed, and 20 mm/s sounds insane (and these slides are from 10+ years ago).
(Wafer dicing = die singulation: cutting up a wafer into individual dies. Laser stealth dicing can be another >10x faster.)

6. Co-packaged optics (CPO) from IBM, to increase interconnection bandwidth density and energy efficiency.
- It uses a polymer waveguide for adiabatic coupling between the fibers and the photonics integrated circuit chip (PIC), with 50 um pitch on the PIC to 250 um pitch SMF array, lead-free reflow compatible + micro-BGA, and passed various reliability and stress test.
- They also included a nice intro graph showing the communication bottleneck: compute has increased 60000x in the past 20 years, but I/O bandwidth only 30x.

8. Forget about the grapple hook horn antenna, here is a spiral antenna made with NiTi shape memory alloy, that literally gets turned on when it felt hot, erect itself, and shoot out higher freq waves better.

9. Look at their forked tongues for chemical edge/gradient detection, and a "membrane bolometer" inside their pit organ for IR detection.

10. Commercial drone market is growing 33% every year in China, and 8.5% rest of the world.

11. Fancy harmonic oscillators
- It's an array of six inductively coupled LC resonators, where the capacitors are air-gap parallel plate, the upper plates being also high Q (10 million) membrane mechanical resonators.
- They could couple them so strong, and cool down the collective motions with the microwave sideband. I guess it is the first time for collective motion of collective motion (macroscopic mechanical oscillators) to be put in quantum ground state and thus they got in science.

14. Ran into this company called [Brilliance RGB](https://brilliancergb.com) that is doing RGB lasers integrated onto SiN photonic integrated circuit (PIC) chip. The first demo seems to be butt coupled, and the most recent one has three laser dies and one NTC bonded onto the PIC.
Not much else happening on the PIC yet. The scanning part would be another challenge for AR/VR.

15. About to say I found an interactive animated coupled oscillator simulation, but [this crazy website](https://falstad.com/mathphysics.html) actually has all kinds of interactive maths and physics stuff, from acoustics to E&M to quantum to thermal... I'm struggling to decide what to include here.
- The four I picked are coupled oscillators, hydrogen molecular ion orbits, hydrogen atom wave functions (I've played with them in Mathematica before, these two are the best visuals I have ever seen and played with), and gas molecules.

16. Virgin optical Coriolis force guiding: we heat up a PDMS pipe with a helix wire, so it wraps around and pushes the light beam back
- Chad plasma channel guiding: 500 TW laser pulses creating plasma in a sheet of supersonic gas and guides itself, and accelerate electrons to ~ 10 GeV (laser plasma-wakefield particle acceleration).
- I have no idea how the wakefield acceleration works. The guiding sounds very similar to Kerr lens.

17. I was being ignorant. Relatively cutting edge open source PDKs do exist, such as ASAP7 (7 nm) and FreePDK3 (3 nm), with many process and design rule details.
Maybe I should also look harder for photonics.

18. "A new Science Robotics study describes how a reinforcement Learning-based strategy can individually control up to 200 laser-driven microrobots within a swarm and train them to collectively move or transport cargo." (see tweet from [Science Robotics](https://x.com/SciRobotics/status/1871621887869989306))
- I'm more impressed by how they could push stuff with the 6 um diameter microswimmers controlled with laser, as optical tweezers has no chance of generating this much force without burning stuff. Optoelectronic tweezers maybe.
- Turns out the particles are in a binary fluid mixture near its critical point, and selective heating from the laser on the particles cause local demixing, and that's where the force is from. Average laser power needed is only ~ 1 uW to get ~ 1 um/s.

- Here is a new Nvidia challenger I found emerged recently called [OptiCore](https://opticore.ai), by Berkeley and MIT folks, based on "coherent VCSEL neural networks" they prototyped in 2023.
- Although it's going to take a lot of effort and a long time, I'm a fan of this approach out of many different kinds of optical neural networks (ONNs, which I'm not an expert on, I just know some basic photonics).
