# Piezoelectric Semiconductors and Pyroelectric Effects  

Hmm piezoelectric materials that are also semiconductors. Could be useful for some weird applications.
Never thought about comparing both piezoelectricity and bandgap at the same time.

No measure of mobility though, also no acoustic propagation loss.

# Femtosecond Laser Poling for SAW Generation 

Is there a word for describing the feeling when you found someone had the same weird idea that you deemed too hard to try, and they found someone else had done it before?

This is about using periodic poling to transduce acoustic waves instead of interdigital transducer (you need the periodicity one way or another to phase-match with the acoustic waves), so the electrodes are much easier to pattern, and you could potentially excite much higher frequency at lower poling period. Otherwise the electrodes would get too narrow & lossy & have self resonances.

This is made possible because people figured out how to do poling with fs lasers ~10 years ago, making it much more versatile.

   - Ok this fs laser poling is actually pretty interesting and crazy, it is not using the E field of the laser, but from the thermoelectric/pyroelectric effect of the nonlinear crystal itself, and thus the E field looks like it's from a charge (temperature change), and has different

# Room-Temperature Telecom-Compatible Quantum Memory  


A room temperature Rb vapor cell as a quantum memory can now get entangled with telecom photons (1324 nm) at 1.2 kHz rate and 80% fidelity.

Wondering if there are people tracking the rate/fidelity over time.

# Mode Management in High-Power Fiber Lasers  

A standard single mode fiber SMF-28 could handle < 1 MW/cm², or ~< 1W with its ~10 um mode diameter. Making the mode bigger is one of the most straightforward way to get higher power, however you get more modes and their effective index are also much closer to each other.

Large pitch fiber is one way to deal with these higher order modes (HOM), by arranging extra holes in a clever way. It makes the HOM much lossier because they see more boundaries, and less overlapping with the gain region at the center.

Their core diameter is ~100 um, and could support ~300 W of CW power and few GW of peak power.

   - If you just use weak step-index for guiding, the mode would get squeezed when the fiber is slightly bent.

# Fast Microring Modulators in Silicon Photonics 

The first (?) silicon photonics microring modulators (MRM) from 20 years ago, and where MRMs are now.

The ring draws in power and gives you dips in transmission when you are on its resonances, thus you could modulate its resonance to modulate the transmission.

Quiz: they are modulating at more than a few tens of GHz. What happens to the ring resonator's spectrum when you are modulating faster than the resonance's linewidth/response time?

# Extracting Energy from Earth’s Rotation  

Energy harvesting from Earth's rotation? Surely that is a good idea.

# 1999 vs. 2025 Superconducting Qubits  

The "superconducting qubit" from 1999 that could live for ~2 ns, and a superconducting qubit in 2025 that could stay alive for almost 2 ms.

(scale bar in second pic is 200 um, it's a dark field image of the black tantalum ground plane and a few capacitance pads on dark grey silicon, and a nonlinear inductor made with aluminum & Al oxide Josephson junction at the center)

   - T1 = 1.68 ± 0.1 ms, T2E ~ 1.2*T1
   - The junction was deposited with a plassys with chamber pressure of 3e-10 Torr..

   - Fluxonium qubits (a different kind of SC qubits) have also achieved > 1 ms coherence time, albeit "cheating" a bit since it is strongly nonlinear, and the qubit transition is at a much lower freq. As a result, ~10 mK is no longer cold enough and they need active cooling.

   - I have to highlight this shape that looks like two hooks in the qubit where the junction layers (ebeam litho) and the capacitor pads (photolitho) overlap.
   - I wonder how many people saw it in Julian Kelly's thesis and various UCSB papers, had no idea what it was for (I still have no idea), and decided to keep it the same for safety (yes we did).

# Satellite-Based Quantum Key Distribution  


The first satellite-to-ground quantum key distribution (QKD) was already 8 years ago. Now they have reduced the payload by 10x to 23 kg, the ground station by 100x (from an observatory to a portable telescope), and they are thinking about quantum satellite constellations.

   - Not much change on key rate (a few tens of kHz) and error rate (~1%).
   - Aperture reduced from 300 mm and 1000 mm to 200 mm and 280 mm.
   - Similar tracking level of few urad.
   - Pictures below from the 2017 paper.

# Magnetorheological Finishing for Precision Optics  

I did not dig into what is the exact polishing method at the time, and it is pretty mind blowing: it's called magnetorheological finishing, and it is used for big optics a lot more.

It reduces damages because the particles in the slurry are aligned with a magnetic field, and the "fluid's shape and stiffness can be magnetically manipulated and controlled in real time."

People make amazing aspheres and large aperture optics (>400 mm) with it.

# Carbon Nanotube Arrays and Racetracks  

Single-walled carbon nanotube arrays? SWNT rings and racetracks?? Crazy. Beautiful. My respect to people who kept pushing on these "unpredictable" little things.

# Acoustic Droplet Robots with Liquid Marbles  

Miniature T-1000 is not on my bingo card for the current robotics hype.

It's DI water droplets frozen & coated with PTFE particles (eww), and they could "navigating through complex environments, engulfing and transporting cargoes, merging, and adapting to various environments".
Driven by acoustic radiation force from an ultrasonic transducer, nothing fancy inside. (tbf water itself is fancy tech)
