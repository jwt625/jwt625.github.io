1. Air-to-ground and air-to-air optical comm with drones and vehicles using 15 W white LEDs, capable of 2 Mbps and up to ~ 40 m when collimated. They showed real-time video transmission with them. The alignment is achieved with a 3-axis gimbal, a web cam, and image recognition.

2. Here is how you make a sub-micron diameter quartz fiber in late nineteenth century: pull it out with an arrow and a crossbow.

3. Application note from Montana Instruments on high NA optics at 4 K (and more).
Big pain to get the chip and a long WD objective close enough with the heat shield and the vacuum enclosure in between, both had to get really close to the windows. Nice they put the objective inside.

4. "Electroencephalography (EEG) + machine learning capable of predicting e-sports match outcomes with ~80% accuracy"
- What
- Opens up the paper
- It is Street Fighter V
(btw you have to play it for 5+ yr and average 1+ h a day to participate the study)

5. A home-based tDCS treatment "showed a greater reduction in depressive symptoms than a control group"
Looks inside: hmm the error bar is standard error, not standard deviation?
Looks into the SI: okay put anything on the head works it seems
(HDRS = Hamilton Depression Rating Scale)

(it has the longest SI I've seen so far, 163 pages)

   - Another fun thing I learnt is that Europe has a health related quality of life measure, and they named it like a perfect part number: [EQ-5D-Y-5L](https://euroqol.org)

6. Power over fiber when: coherent made a *single mode* fiber that is capable of > 20 W of optical power!
![20241027_053614_0.jpg](/assets/images/2024/20241008_20241031/20241027_053614_0.jpg)

7. Wafer-scale Si3N4 photonic IC suffer from high stress and cracking. Damascene process solves it but has worse control over thickness, uniformity etc. This paper solves it by literally anchoring the Si3N4 with trenches, and showed comparable optical propagation lost.

8. This is the best you can do for world’s smallest Rubik’s Cube? Who's printing one that's 10x smaller with nanoscribe and rotating it with laser beams.

   - The [Guinness world records website](https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/smallest-rubiks-cube-) looks like a scam website
   - Can't even find it on their website

9. The moon tonight is gorgeous... These papers tried to measure the moon illusion and found it is usually claimed to be 50% different between the horizon and zenith moon.
Experiments involving human perception feel so tricky to do.

10. Found a gem of that one time when a chip flew off tweezers, spent ~10 min looking for it, and it was stuck to the outside of the fume hood
(still working on the EBL blog and going thru stuff)

11. How do you make lenses and mirrors for ionizing high power laser beams? Use already ionized stuff (a plasma).
The plasma is shaped by interference pattern between two lasers first, just like how holography and fiber bragg grating are made.

12. The modern version: keystroke sniffing with off-the-shelf smartphone.

14. Some nice figures from a report on potential PFAS restriction in semiconductor sector:
- Semiconductor value chain
- Comparison between biological and technological devices
- Evolution and status of semiconductor packaging
(PFAS = per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances)

15. I printed a little windcup (cad from openSCAD) using nanoscribe a while ago (and some chains, and a rick). It worked after poking it with a fiber to break the support lol.
