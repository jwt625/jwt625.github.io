# Cubic millimeter fluorescence monitor for microtissues

damn, you can fit a lot of stuff within a single cubic millimeter

# Millisecond camera sync using LED clock ring

how do you sync a bunch of various grade and wavelength cameras down to ~1 ms? a custom LED clock with 100 ms resolution timestamps, and 100 LEDs in a circle lighting up 1 ms at a time in sequence.

# Photonic chip packaging and co-packaged optics cost

guess how much the processing and packaging of this photonic chip cost? (just the processing and packaging of this chip)

   - 2500 bucks. cant find any info about the H-chiptect company that did most of the fab. packaging done by CUMEC, seems to be Chongqing United Microelectronics Center.

Ongoing:
- GDSJam:
   - week 75: many [commits and PRs](https://github.com/jwt625/gdsjam). Also tried vide coding a chip using claude and GDSFactory ([tweet](https://x.com/jwt0625/status/1995332640539615721)). Added examples on front page:
   ![gdsjam-examples](/assets/images/projects/gdsjam-examples.png)
   - week 74: got MVP of a MVP working, can do full client side rendering, and basic file sync. Made a [tweet](https://x.com/jwt0625/status/1992508531078263058) about it.
   - Week 73: bought a domain [GDSJam.com](https://gdsjam.com)

      - Updated [3dgs viewer](https://github.com/jwt625/3dgs-viewer) to include 3rd order SH
      - setup and played with `kimi k2 thinking`, it barely runs on 8xH100.
      - Continued [DocEater](https://github.com/jwt625/DocEater)
         - started parsing all safe pdfs in my download folder. Actually as I type here (Sun Nov  9 23:28:59 PST 2025) it just finished the first pass:
