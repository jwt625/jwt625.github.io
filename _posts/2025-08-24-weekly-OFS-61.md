# Scalable photonic quantum computing with boson sampling

"Scalable" photonic quantum technologies

( this is "old" work from USTC from 2020 )

   - from Zhong2020: [Quantum computational advantage using photons](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abe8770)
   - because of this review reminded me of it.

   - since then they have more and more stuff onto chips, and they also figured things are easier to do in time or frequency domain.

   - i did not read the SI at the time, it's quite impressive. They even included the full matrix of the 100 mode interferometer.

# Consolidation of semi-active photonic integration platforms

when would we have the great consolidation of semi-active photonics stack? would it make sense / ever happen?

( recent examples from EPFL, QuEra/Sandia, PsiQuantum, and imec )

   - as you could see silicon nitride is the popuular waveguide material (there are a lot of other monolithic approach, i.e., directly making waveguides out of LN/LT/BTO etc. ). For these heterogeneous approaches, the EO / piezo layer is still changing materials and locations.

# Compact chiral spectrometer with metalens

one of the most confusing and sketchy setup ive seen in a while 

it's a metalens with large focusing angle, that's why it looks almost perpendicular to the cmos sensor, and the wafer is straight taped onto a rotational stage..

# High-speed volumetric multifocus microscopy

"yes"

# Document processing tool comparison

friendship ended with docling.

now marker is my best friend.

( both still mess up section and subsection levels, but marker is a bit better )
![20250702_080913_0.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20240822_20250825/20250702_080913_0.jpg)

   - [Marker](https://github.com/datalab-to/marker)
   - summary by claude:
   

Processing Time:   Marker 31.5s (0.5m) | Docling 143s (2.4m) | Winner: Marker 4.5x faster
Formula Extraction: Marker 13 formulas  | Docling 5 formulas  | Winner: Marker
Image Extraction:   Marker 6 images     | Docling 7 images    | Winner: Docling
Structure Analysis: Marker 71 cells     | Docling 2 tables    | Winner: Marker
Debug Info:         Marker Extensive    | Docling Moderate    | Winner: Marker
Setup Complexity:   Marker High         | Docling Medium      | Winner: Docling
Model Size:         Marker 2.7GB        | Docling 2GB         | Winner: Docling
Config Options:     Marker 200+         | Docling Moderate    | Winner: Marker


Major Finding:
- Marker is ~4.5x faster
- Previous 8 min measurement included model downloads

Marker - Clear Winner:
- 4.5x faster processing
- Better formula extraction (13 vs 5)
- Stronger structure analysis (71 cells)
- More debug features
- Extensive configuration options
- Tradeoffs: larger model (2.7GB vs 2GB), higher setup complexity

Docling - Solid Alternative:
- Simpler setup
- Smaller model size
- Decent all-around performance
- Tradeoffs: slower (4.5x), fewer formulas, weaker structure analysis

Final Verdict:
Marker is superior for most use cases: faster, more accurate, more detailed.
Docling only if setup simplicity is critical.
Both are production-ready.



# Simulation software preferences for multiphysics

dear FEM/FDTD/CFD twitter, id like your opinion on your most/least favorite simulation softwares, and why you like or hate it.
both commercial and open source ones welcome. I'd like to try out more open source ones.

   - i'm a big comsol fan, and i think it's on a rising trajectory. Plus if you are morphing your brain into the shape of the UI/UX of one of these tools, why not choose the one that use the same framework and UI for all kinds of physics and multiphysics.

# Fully-actuated drone with six degrees of freedom

TIL a fully-actuated drone would need six props / actuators for the six DOFs, and you could have over-actuated drone that can hover and fly at any orientation, using the extra DOFs to optimize other objectives.
(this one has six propellers and six arm-angle servos)

      - https://bay-bridge-traffic.com
      - I think it is already getting hit hard and slowing down the detection, might have to take this down
      - nope not really getting hit hard, not sure what it was, added some rate limiting and restarted things, now back to 30 fps most of the time
   - week 58: Bay bridge traffic tracker
