1. Imagine a new chip comes out and makes your Nvidia GPU 5x cheaper. This is kind of what MOS Technology 6502 did to Motorola in 1975.

2. This LEGO enthusiast makes really good 3D model / part list / assembling instruction for the designs

3. The wafer holders are worth 10s to 100s bucks for big wafers! Do not throw them away when you ordered old wafers for decoration

4. HDMI to screw terminal adapters exist... I need to come up with a fun project to use them.

7. "As chipmaking required finer and finer features, engineers had to produce more and more complex designs to project those features onto the silicon. Inverse lithography (ILT) is the latest development"

9. Six to seven discrete depth would be enough to fool Human vision
- Optics Express paper: [Optimal allocation of quantized human eye depth perception for multi-focal 3D display design](https://opg.optica.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-29-7-9878&id=449280)

10.  I always have thought it is the signal from the left eye going to the right half of the brain and vice versa. It is actually the visual field instead.
