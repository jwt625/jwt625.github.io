# Satirical site on crystalline quantum protection

Just shipped [quantacrystals.org](https://quantacrystals.org) after discovering what Big Physics has been hiding from us. Spent the new year's first day's after lunch nap time building a platform that exposes the TRUTH about crystalline quantum protection. While CERN scientists have been using Ti:Sapphire and Ce:LuAG crystals in their billion-dollar facilities, they never told us about the bioelectric harmonization properties. The same scintillator materials that detect cosmic radiation in particle accelerators? Yeah, they can totally shield your aura from 5G towers. It's just basic quantum coherence. Share this with your friends and families, together we can scam the scammers into reading real science. Or are we?

# Nanostencil-patterned OLEDs with directional emission

new nano LEDs from ETH Zurich, made with organic alchemy using a nitride membrane as a nanostencil. They are so closely spaced changing their pattern and shape could change their emission direction and polarization. sadly they die after a bit longer than 1 h.

# 1859 submarine telegraph cable manufacturing

"When the Merrimac cable was laid, we toiled through the gloom of night. The sun had gone far behind the western horizon. The moon had come and gone, as though it was hurrying after the god of day that had just withdrawn its last ray; the stars remained, and from the blue depths of their abode their glimmering beams added to make the scene sublime. In the stillness of night, surrounded by a deep and dismal forest, where the foot of man had seldom trod, we were busily engaged in preparing a pathway for a messenger, mantled in a flame, that was to be the first to greet the rising sun in the east and the last to bid it adieu in the far west--to carry tidings from the ice-bound north to the green palm and blooming magnolia regions of the south. Our couch was God's footstool, and we were sheltered from the dews of heaven by the forest foliage. We were lulled to sleep by the croaking of the frog, the chirping of the cricket, the whooping of the owl and the yell of the panther! Time can never erase from the mind the reminiscences of those scenes--eternity alone can pass them beyond the pale of memory."

   - "In manufacturing these cables we did not have the convenience of machinery and the variety of mechanical appliances common to populated countries. We were in the West, the great West, in the shades of the forest. The earth was our floor, the blue arched heaven our canopy, and the horizon the only limit of our saloon."

# In-memory compute using off-the-shelf DRAM

been reading in-memory compute, and it reminds me of quantum computing a lot lol, there's ancilla bit involved, there's "error correction" with the sense amplifier, and there's even "dual-rail encoding".

   - it works by running outside of spec for the memory controller command sequence so that you are suffling charge around "mid operation", and you could get some reliable truth table with three bits. you do have to tune how you violate the specs for different DRAM vendors.

      - I think it is already getting hit hard and slowing down the detection, might have to take this down
