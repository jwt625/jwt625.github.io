# Plasmonic integrated circuits

i used to despise plasmonic a little bit because how lossy it is, but it's much closer to actual useful products than many other vaporwares with e.g. supposedly zero loss

( a 200 mm commercial 3rd party wafer post-processed with plasmonic structures from Polariton Technologies )

# HDD mechanical accuracy analogy

This analogy for the mechanical accuracy of HDDs is nuts: "Imagine a hard drive head as a 747 flying over a grassy field at 75 miles per hour. The air gap between the bottom of the plane and the top of the grass is two sheets of paper." (1/2)

   - "If we measure bits on the disk as blades of grass, the track width would be 4.6 blades of grass wide and the bit length would be 1 blade of grass. The plane would count blades of grass and only miss one blade for every 25 thousand times the plane circled the Earth." (2/2)

# Bosonic circuit QED components

Welcome to the club of bosonic cQED, we have on-chip micro-strippers, lambda/4 pole dancers, niobium mushroom growers, and as-many-holes-as-you-want. I ran out of imagination for the remaining two.

# PhD research documentation details

So I asked my advisor last week if I could write up (in a fun and detailed way) shit I did during my PhD, and he said do whatever you want, "it's publicly funded and cannot be confidential". I'll need some help determine where to start...
   - Here is one example of the details and fun that are missing in a lot of papers. Left is what you would see in a paper, and right is 1/3 of the actual stuff. I've been reading more robotics, CV, and ML stuff recently. How they present their work is on a whole different level...

   - I dont have a good sneak peek for the quantum frequency conversion story, but it is a long story, and we improved how good the device is by 1e8x over three years.

# Micro Fabry-Perot self-injection locking

honestly a lot of potential for on-chip "free space optics" components, many of them are just hard to beat.
here a micro Fabry–Perot cavity made of ULE is used for self injection locking.

   <!-- - it's an integration over lithium tantalate -->

# Photodetector electrode slot design

legit question, why do they leave slots on the photodetector electrodes? enforcing local symmetry for reasons?

( not the gap between the signal and ground, but the slots in the same electrodes )

Ongoing:
- Playground:
   - week 65: Added more analysis to [bay bridge traffic](https://github.com/jwt625/bay-bridge-traffic-cam)
      - should really continue one-click-paper-page!
   - week 63:
      - Continuing [one click web paper](https://github.com/jwt625/PlayGround/tree/main/20250831_one_click_paper_page). Got actual deployment working. Had to refactor backend etc.
      - Also added traffic speed to [Bay Bridge traffic](https://bay-bridge-traffic.com). The repo was spun off from PlayGround last weekend iirc.
      ![BBT-speed](/assets/images/2025/BBT-speed.png)
   - week 62: [one click web paper](https://github.com/jwt625/PlayGround/tree/main/20250831_one_click_paper_page)

      - https://bay-bridge-traffic.com
      - I think it is already getting hit hard and slowing down the detection, might have to take this down
      - nope not really getting hit hard, not sure what it was, added some rate limiting and restarted things, now back to 30 fps most of the time
   - week 58: Bay bridge traffic tracker
