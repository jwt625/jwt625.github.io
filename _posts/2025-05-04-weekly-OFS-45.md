# CaF2 whispering gallery mode optical resonator

ohhhhh look at this CaF2 whispering gallery mode optical resonator (and two coupling fibers)

It's made with single point diamond turning process (SPDT), and then polished with grit size of 20, 3, 1, 0.25, 0.1, and 0.05 µm.
"A Q factor exceeding 1e10 is usually achieved after a 0.25 µm polishing step."

# Warm metalworking of semiconductors

Warm metalworking of semiconductors, and you can roll some of them down to um scale thin films at only 100~200C, plastic 3d printing temperatures!

However those are the uncommon ones, still need e.g. ~350C for InP, ~450C for Ge, and ~550C for Si. And surface quality & defect density etc are critical for some applications.

# FBG accelerometer for low-frequency vibration

It actually makes sense because it is for low-frequency vibration monitoring.

# Quantum feedback cooling theory

quantum feedback cooling is fun to think about: if you are trying to stop (i.e. cooling) a swing, you apply a force that's opposite to its velocity.
Now the question is: can you cool it down to the absolute zero temperature?

(o3 could get the basic idea, but would confidently making stuff up for details. n is the mode occupation number. It's intuitive to see there should be an optimal feedback strength, but the actual expressions are not straightforward..)

# Nine-layer superconducting SFQ circuits

TIL people have made superconducting circuits as many as nine layers and as early as more than 10 years ago, for large-scale single flux quantum (SFQ) circuits.

They've made shift registers with 70,000 JJs with 100% yield, as well as clock freq up to 120 GHz.

# Superconducting qubit control with JPG

just learnt about this superconducting qubit control approach with classical pulses from JJs.

Typically you drive the qubit states based on Rabi oscillations, and you control the pulse phase and strength/duration to control the final state, which means it is totally analog.

Here each pulse from a current driving a 2pi phase in a JJ generating a voltage pulse which integrates to a single flux quantum, it is much shorter duration (few to few tens of ps) than the qubit transition freq (a few GHz), and thus you send multiple ones and control their timing to match the qubit freq (or its subharmonics).

This is still Rabi oscillation based, but now it is "segmented", and thus the amplitude control is digital. However the phase is still analog. Wondering if there is a way to get around the analog phase..
![20250504_051323_0.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20241230_20250505/20250504_051323_0.jpg)
   - The Josephson Pulse Generator (JPG) is at 3 K to avoid quasiparticles poisoning the qubit chip. Fidelity limit from digitization is quite decent, and would get better for better qubit coherence time.
   - (finer digital control needs smaller pulses & more pulses, but the repetition is limited by the qubit freq and thus the whole sequence would take more time & limited by the qubit coherence. Why can't they do e.g. repetition at the 2nd or 3rd harmonics of the qubit freq?)

   - correction/update: I think if there is a way to control the phase (lol I know) of the JPG pulses, then driving at 2nd and higher harmonics repetition should be possible.
   - Just flip/update the phase of the pulses in the sequence accordingly and they should still add up coherently.
   - in the 2019 paper, the JPG is 3.5 mm away on the same chip but the quasiparticles still spoiled the qubit a bit and capped the gate fidelity

   - Here's how the splitter might have worked: very roughly speaking you just need to make sure you excite the symmetric radially outgoing "slab mode" while minimizing reflection, and also minimize reflection at the slab to waveguide transitions.

   - it's always a bit counterintuitive to me how much easier it is to make S11 low for mw/mmw compared to optics/photonics, insert some subwavelength thingy just right and boom you are done.

   - coax to radial slab mode part, picked some random params for the "staircase" lol
   - (have to go now maybe will play more later)
   - (Sad thing about optics/photonics is there is no coax (?), and this would have crazy scattering all over the place even when you guarantee the symmetry, meanwhile mw/mmw stuff you could have true single-mode guiding, and only need to worry about matching better / reducing reflection)

# Human intelligence relevance

maybe it just takes a bit more getting used to to accept the fact that human intelligence will stop being relevant?

(although very often I still need to move concrete/lumber/dirt myself, and weight of a bag of concrete mix is clearly designed to be carried by one person, while decent intelligence is already dirt cheap)

# Gyrotron system for tokamak


yeah yeah sure it is low power

# Projects


Procrastinating:
- Droplet walker
- TabTreeTracker
- Low cost robot arm
- Joystick doomscrolling


Planning:
- Wave demo with ~ 300 Hz water surface wave + 3D printed components


Ongoing:
- 3D Gaussian splatting
   - week 5 (45): got data from dilfridge and a wirebonder at Stanford. The dilfridge one is not working even after tuning colmap parameters
   - week 4 (?) (44): reading about webGL. Need more specific goals.
   - week 1~3: did 3DGS on various teardowns such as transceivers and lasers / laser modules
- WIMS (where is my shit):
   - week 7 (45): getting bored of it. Need to figure out a better way to wear it, and a better way to switch it on and off instead of manually plugging & unplugging the battery
   - week 5 (43): no progress this week, continue wearing it.
   - week 4 (42): switched to a LiPo battery, it lasts several days!
   - week 3 (41): got a usb type-C power monitor. Sleep power too high, need debug
   - week 2 (40): Started wearing the camera at home & send thru wifi to desktop. Need to somehow save or send the photo to my phone when outside.
   - ![WIMS](/assets/images/projects/WIMS-20250330.png)
   - week 1 (39): I finally connected to the camera. Quality bad. Ordered new camera (OV5640) from aliexpress.
- Quantum frequency conversion plot
   - week 4 (41): procrastinating
   - week 3 (40): procrastinating
   - Week 2 (39): published it, currently has piezo-optomechanical approaches
   - Week 1 (38): Gave a talk at PsiQuantum. I like the hat.
- [interactive wave](https://github.com/jwt625/interactwave)
   - week 1 (37): made a python standalone library, see [BPM](https://github.com/jwt625/BPM).
- fiber2chip [blog](https://jwt625.github.io/tutorial/fiber2chip-history-concept/)
- backyard landscaping: 
   - week 19 (45): finally building the deck frame for the upper deck
   ![backyard-19](/assets/images/2025/20241230_20250505/deck-19.png)
   - week 18 (44): update railings, made a small outdoor wood stairs
   ![backyard-18](/assets/images/2025/20240830_20250427/Gpfc0tybEAE3-WG.jpeg)
   - Week 17 (43): no progress this week
   - [week 16 (42)](https://x.com/jwt0625/status/1911204437353529571): continue cinder block wall, finished upper level. Had to cast another small chunk of concrete
   - ![GoX2RDzXkAA0f09](/assets/images/2025/20240918_20250414/GoX2RDzXkAA0f09.jpeg)
   - [week 15 (41)](https://x.com/jwt0625/status/1908666642453963155): continue cinder block wall, added geogrid and two more layers of blocks. Also tear down stair form OSB
   - ![GnzxClEbYAEqjqX](/assets/images/2025/20250225_20250406/GnzxClEbYAEqjqX.jpeg)
   - week 14 (40): no progress this week
   - week 13 (39): finished stairs. Started wall with cinder block. Formed and poured concrete at the turn
   - week 12 (38): traveled to LA this weekend! No backyard work.
   - week 11 (37): working on the form of the stairs, deck joists
   - week 10 (36): did not work on it
   - week 9 (35): finished the deck joists and boarded the side of the deck
   - week 8 (34): finished jacuzzi base & deck frame
   - week 7 (33): working on base for Jacuzzi
   - week 6 (32): new year
   - week 5 (31): flattened the bottom level, put down form for concrete curb. Put down linear / grass barrier, and then gravel
   - week 4 (30): Finished the bottom retaining wall
   - week 3 (29): concrete poured for retaining wall beams and deck posts, started putting on retaining wall panels
   - week 2 (28): dig holes, posts inside holes, worked on Living room
   - week 1 (27): first week


Finished:
- (week 32:) SiPho writeup for [avi](https://x.com/byte_thrasher)'s zine.
   - week 36: published on blog
- Continuing [redacted]
   - Week 36: This has been finished.
- PIC pytorch
   - week 3 (42): [redacted]
   - week 2 (41): [redacted]
   - week 1 (40): built a few simple components. Tested simple backprop and training.
   - ![PIC-torch](/assets/images/projects/PIC_pytorch_20250330.png)


Gave up
- Traveling wave excitation of mechanical ring resonator (see [this thread](https://x.com/jwt0625/status/1877578653648986365))
- [Tiny Tapeout](https://github.com/jwt625/tt-test)
   - abort? (because of efabless no funding)
