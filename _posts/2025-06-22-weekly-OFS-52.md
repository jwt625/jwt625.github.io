# Diamond membrane transfer process pain

One of my friends' paper is out. Can you feel the pain he's been thru
I've done transfer process less than half this complicated and it felt incredible. And there's a lot of horror stories from him about how critical the chamber is for growing the diamond.

# Silicon metaoptics for visible light

you'd be treated as crazy to propose using silicon for visible optics/photonics because it's lossy below ~1 um, but it actually works quite ok for metasurfaces / metaoptics
also I had no idea you could directly get thin film silicon (230 nm in their case) on sapphire from university wafers

# Hexanitrogen explosive properties

new clean bomb/fuel molecule just dropped, made out of sticking six nitrogen atoms together, decompose to nitrogen gas and releasing 185 kcal/mol or 2.2 kcal/g, about twice of TNT and HMX (still far from beating hydrogen combustion though)

however it's not stable at room T, and stable for 100+ years at liquid nitrogen temperature (funny the only thing involved is still just nitrogen atoms)

   - thats a lot of stress

   - the image is taken with [Differential interference contrast microscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_interference_contrast_microscopy), the wikipedia page has a nice example of "Laser-induced optical damage in LiNbO3"

   - people actually use similar technique to correct for small deformations in thin mirrors

   - reminds me of a very similar approach for etching LN, even with the same chemical (diluted HF), but the crystalline to amorphous with argon ion beam

Ongoing:
- [mouse & keystroke tracker](https://github.com/jwt625/PlayGround/tree/main/20250606_keyLogging)
   - week 1 (50): got basics working. Need to add chrome extension for more fine grained tracking

- 3D Gaussian splatting
   - week 8 (48): no progress. Do the 3rd order SH!!!
   - week 7 (47): no progress
   - week 6 (46): no progress, spent some time trying to add 3rd order SH. Still not working.
   - week 5 (45): got data from dilfridge and a wirebonder at Stanford. The dilfridge one is not working even after tuning colmap parameters
   - week 4 (?) (44): reading about webGL. Need more specific goals.

- WIMS (where is my shit):
   - week 8 (46): no progress. Add the switch!
   - week 7 (45): getting bored of it. Need to figure out a better way to wear it, and a better way to switch it on and off instead of manually plugging & unplugging the battery
   - week 5 (43): no progress this week, continue wearing it.
   - week 4 (42): switched to a LiPo battery, it lasts several days!
   - week 3 (41): got a usb type-C power monitor. Sleep power too high, need debug
   - week 2 (40): Started wearing the camera at home & send thru wifi to desktop. Need to somehow save or send the photo to my phone when outside.
   - ![WIMS](/assets/images/projects/WIMS-20250330.png)
   - week 1 (39): I finally [connected to the camera](https://github.com/jwt625/PlayGround/tree/main/20250108_arduino/wearable_camera). Quality bad. Ordered new camera (OV5640) from aliexpress.
- Quantum frequency conversion plot
   - week 4 (41): procrastinating
   - week 3 (40): procrastinating
   - Week 2 (39): published it, currently has piezo-optomechanical approaches
   - Week 1 (38): Gave a talk at PsiQuantum. I like the hat.
