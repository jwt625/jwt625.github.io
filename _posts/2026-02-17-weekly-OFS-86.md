# Techno-Economic Comparison of Silicon Photonics and VCSELs

“If you compete with CMOS, don’t !”  -- Journal of Lightwave Technology, Volume: 34, Issue: 2, Jan 2016

# Optical Interconnects and Dense Compute Infrastructure

who knows how long it will take, but when we got low power low latency chip to chip optical interconnects, do you still need this dense of compute? does packing denser power supply and cooling still give you higher energy efficiency? why are we still making racks? i remember a compute wall concept from some OCP presentations, i should dig it out
![20251228_003509_0.jpg](/assets/images/2026/20240611_20260216/20251228_003509_0.jpg)
![20251228_003509_1.jpg](/assets/images/2026/20240611_20260216/20251228_003509_1.jpg)
   - density the compute: long term yes, in the short term the whole stack is lagging behind on how fast the compute is getting dense, like the floor to support the increasing weight of the rack..
   <!-- - yes, also not gonna be anytime soon in terms of just the cost of the link even with MMF. maybe some win overall as a single rack's power approaching a physical cap, not sure how much more we can get going beyond 1 MW racks. -->
   - this is what i was thinking of: [Building a Digital Twin, ASIC Emulation Platform using the OCP HPCM Wall of Compute]( https://youtube.com/watch?v=7BoEj7HwPLA)
   ![20251229_181043_0.jpg](/assets/images/2026/20240611_20260216/20251229_181043_0.jpg)
   - main diff is propagation loss, fiber has effective zero until you get capped by dispersion with multimode fiber etc. Copper coax/twisted pair gives you few meters at the baud rate nvlinks are running. 100% on the hearing hazard.


# Calculus as a Universal Problem-Solving Tool

when i was a middle school student, my high school neighbor told me theres this magical technology that could solve all the problems in the world and it is called calculus. I felt so good looking forward to learning it soon one day and solve all the world's problems with it.
![20260207_175451_0.jpg](/assets/images/2026/20240611_20260216/20260207_175451_0.jpg)
- [context](https://x.com/stevesi/status/2020194561277259796): Thinking about that time (1980s) the markets thought object-oriented programming would:
   - * turn software in little parts effortlessly combined into apps with no skills
   - * be so easy even a baby would code

# macOS UI Limitations and Debugging OBS

i thought this is only a windows meme i guess macos also sucks.
![20260208_065255_0.jpg](/assets/images/2026/20240611_20260216/20260208_065255_0.jpg)
   - i was doing it, i have many other complaints about macos being too protective..
   - it's just me debugging OBS stream getting periodically killed by macos. No LLM involved.

# Browser Extension for Inline Supplementary Videos

im pissed off enough time by the horrible UI these journals have esp. you have to download the SI videos to watch them, and sometimes they have cursed format and encoding, so here is an extension to load the video inline as well as converting it using ffmpeg if needed
   - [Supplementary Video Player]( https://github.com/jwt625/PlayGround/tree/main/20260207_chrome_extension_nature_supplementary_video)
   - also got science ones, which put it in a zip file regardless of how many there are.
   - multi vid with tabs

# The Future Belongs to Transducers

the future is going to belong to transducers and people that make and operate them, transducers between the physical world and the digital world
   - okay maybe I'm wrong about the future belonging to transducers, maybe it belongs to wrappers and hookers


# High-Q Germano-Silicate Photonics Packaging

did they grind the butterfly package open lol, how did the laser facet survive this, or did they cut it open and then did the wirebonding? how?? I'm so confused. maybe they cut it, loaded & wirebonded, and then put the lid on, that could explain why the lid looks intact.

   - "In the science package the optical and opto-electronic components are contained within a machined monolithic optical unit (black anodized Al6061). Each component is provided with a recessed pocket within the unit and is held in the pocket with epoxy (UHU 300). The SPDC photons were directly incident on the APDs without the use of collection lenses. The components most sensitive to alignment are the BBO crystal, and the two mirrors used to direct the photons to the detectors. In particular the BBO crystal had an angular tolerance at the order of± 100 μ rad."

# Metaphorical Journey of Particles in Quantum Systems

how does it feel like when an electron in a GaAs 2DEG jumps in and out of a quantum dot? Would it boast about how sketchy a trap that region was to other fellow electrons? how does it feel like when a superconducting qubit gives birth to a traveling single microwave photon that immerse itself through a TWPA? Would it get confused about all of its clones slowly appearing? how does it feel like when a high power laser pulse gets dispersed, amplified, and then compressed again? Would it leave a will to tell photons in the other beamlines this is such a worthy physical therapy session before hitting the target?

# High-Electro-Optic-Activity Organic Polymers

Lithium niobate still domainposturing at 30 pm/V like it’s guarding the electrothrone, meanwhile tert-butyldiphenylsilyl-armored donor–π–acceptor polymers just hyperstack-sovereign the whole modulation bloodline at 1100 pm/V   

Barium titanate out here ferrocore-cosplaying with perovskite pride while bis(4-dialkylaminophenyl)phenylamino chromophores dipole-ascendancymaxx straight through the waveguide economy. 

Oxide veterans stuck polarization-coping with bulkbrick inertia, but these site-isolated builds are steric-throneguarding, aggregation-exiling, and voltage-throning under high-κ gatekeep tech like dielectric gravity never compiled. Crystalclingers still lattice-virtue signaling while the polymer meta is n³r₃₃-overcrowning the entire electroclout hierarchy.

   - interesting shape for the NiTi tubular with microfluidic channels. the compress and release cycles of the NiTi cause it to heat up and cool down, and the heat exchange fluid changes directions accordingly.

   - you totally can harness redundant mechanical movement of existing systems, the annoying thing is the heat exchange has to match the (potentially varying and random) pace properly to close the cycle

# Lab Hackweek Projects: Alignment Bots and RF Simulators

my former lab did a hackweek and theres a lot of fun stuff, heres screenshots of the fiber alignment bot, the Seiko Elnix 0703A freq locked to a SiTime MEMS chip, the nanofab copilot, and the RF chain simulator

   - is quantum hardware = "like detecting exact heat signatures around a corner, extremely fancy microscopes, and anti cloaking radar."? 
      - kind of, these all share the same feature of measuring extremely weak signals. most hardware for quantum stuff is still mostly classical (i.e. no need to use quantum to model how they work), just very low noise and often overpriced.
   - wirebonds unnecessary? 
      - haha true these were microwave and quantum hardware engineers they got trained to be over cautious

   - week 82:
      - made a [parody website](https://github.com/jwt625/PlayGround/tree/main/20260117_realfab) mimicing the [realfood.gov](https://realfood.gov). Used claude code to mimic it as much as possible. Quite a lot of effort, took hakf a day to get the landing / on load animation and the problems section working. Gemini is pretty bad at describing animations. Did not finish and did not deploy it.
      - also made the hero video for this parody ralfab project, msotly with claude: [readfab announcement (parody)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_u3ubn5D0O8). Narrator voice from ElevenLabs.
      - made a [bad apple ver. with spatial light modulator (SLM)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWsCV2V8U-E) with Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm because claude can do it.
      ![bad-apple-slm](/assets/images/projects/bad_apple_SLM_frame_00444.png)
   - week 81: Reverse engineer Claude code with a proxy server.

   </div>
   - week 80: Made a few websites, including a [meme crystal one](https://quantacrystals.org/)
   <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; gap: 10px;">
     <img src="/assets/images/projects/2025_quantacrystals-1.png" alt="quantacrystals" style="width: 48%; max-width: 100%; height: auto;">

   </div>
   and two on old RTS game sound effects, including [Red Alert 2](https://outside5sigma.com/ra2-sounds/) and [Warcraft 3](https://outside5sigma.com/WC3-sounds/).
      - the voice lines are transcribed and searchable!

      ![wc3-sounds](/assets/images/projects/2025-wc3-sounds.png)
      

Finished:
- Backyard landscaping (week 27-67). Should add this to timeline
   - Should also add the backyard shed to the timeline
