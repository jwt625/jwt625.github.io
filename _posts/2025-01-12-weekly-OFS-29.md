# High-Power Miniature Laser (PCSEL)
Noda group's 3 mm diameter, 50 W continuous-wave single-mode photonic-crystal surface-emitting laser (PCSEL).
- Look at all the ribbon bonds to inject >100 A current into this little chip, liquid cooled with 6°C water.
- No other semiconductor lasers could rival PCSEL's power density, linewidth (3 pm), and beam quality & divergence (0.05 deg), that are approaching gas, solid state, or fiber lasers.

# Heat Engines and Information Theory
Ok heat engines are information arbitrageurs, but when will we get information arbitrageurs as heat engines?

# Broadband Rb Microwave Spectrum Analyzer
Another nice example of converting between time/frequency domain and spatial domain to achieve large bandwidth:
A Rb vapor cell sits next to a magnet, so the Zeeman shift of the hyperfine levels are ~linear wrt. distance to the magnet, which changes the microwave frequency it gets excited at. A laser pulse pumps the atoms to the ground state, followed by the microwave excitation, and probe & imaging.
Although the power detection limit is high, they achieved 1 GHz (>25 GHz expected after further optimization) instantaneous BW with 3 MHz resolution around 13 GHz. Typical real-time spectrum analyzers give you few hundred MHz to few GHz.

# Fast Optical Switching with PT symmetry
Interesting optical switch with "PT-symmetry": use gain to adjust the coupling rate so that it is optically controlled, and much much faster than MEMS alternative (100 ps vs 0.1~1 us). I'm usually a PT symmetry hater, but I like this!
- Now only if they could get the off state IL to be ~< 0.1 dB...

   - Feng2025: [Non-Hermitian hybrid silicon photonic switching](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41566-024-01579-9)
   - The MEMS version from Ming Wu's group, very sick structures. The array is so big it is stitching multiple reticles. The IL and extinction are also much better.
   - And since they are using pull-in effect, they only need 2n control lines for n^2 switches.

# Bent Waveguides for Broadband Coupling
hmm directional coupler (DC) but bent to achieve a larger bandwidth.
The group velocity difference between the even and odd supermodes does not reach zero in a straight DC -> the coupling depends on wavelength to first order. It became possible with bent waveguide -> coupling can be tuned to be first order independent of wavelength.
(still not really broadband)

# Early OCR with Minimal Computing
People used to do OCR with ~100 "flops" of compute, and ~10 kB/s "memory bandwidth", what's your excuse?
(an IBM 650. It did cost "$150,000 in 1959, or roughly $1,500,000 as of 2023")

# Detailed Optical Resonator Protocols
TIL theres a nature protocol journal and it’s actually good: this paper on using optical resonator for biochem sensing has details about all aspects of it including math, fab, surface prep, optical coupling, packaging etc., with actual SOPs and part numbers etc.
- How detailed it is? It has the best descriptions on what and how to make a tapered fiber than anywhere else I’ve seen, better than papers that are just about tapered fibers. (Their example transmission of it sucks tho you should be able to get >90%)
- This honestly has changed my view a bit on this fashion magazine series called nature.

# Real-Time Neutrino (muon) Detection Monitoring
TIL the Super-Kamiokande has a [realtime monitor]((https://www-sk.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/realtimemonitor/)) that shows you the map of signals from the ~13,000 photomultiplier tubes. It updates every few seconds, as cosmic ray muon events are ~2 Hz.
Here is a fresh screenshot I just took.
