That is few nm gap between the head and the platter, ~width of a single strand of DNA.\n\nRecently I heard from a friend that HDDs are filled with helium. Turns out It's been done as early as in the 1950s for the drum memory, in commercial HDDs for more than 10 years, and \"as of March 2020, Helium is used in all high-capacity drives for data-centers. These come from all of the three remaining HDD manufacturers: Western Digital, Seagate, and Toshiba.\"\n\nHelium is much lighter, lower drag, and more laminar than air. It reduces turbulence and random forces on the disks and arms, less acoustic noise, and better thermalization and temperature distribution. However, sealing it is a big hustle. People have tried various ways, and settled with laser welding.",
