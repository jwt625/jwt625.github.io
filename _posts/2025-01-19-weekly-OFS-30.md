# Fractal Design for Polarization-Insensitive SNSPDs  
Just found the same idea used in a [3D print friendly anechoic chamber](https://x.com/jwt0625/status/1841280256537444728) applied to superconducting nanowire single-photon detector (SNSPD), which is usually a meandering line (red region in Fig. 1) a current runs thru (you get a voltage pulse when a photon hits), and thus polarization sensitive. 
- To make it polarization insensitive? Make it into a fractal.

# Supercomputers and AI Training Growth Rates Compared  
Superconputers and AI trainings. Not a fair comparison but the growth rates are pretty different.
![20240910_025258_0.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20240910_20250117/20240910_025258_0.jpg)

- (also was trying to find a review paper with better figures from last year, spent 2 h and still looking, it's still so hard to find things with vague memories and descriptions...)
   - It's very similar to this one ([Compute Trends Across Three Eras of Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05924)) but I'm pretty sure it's more recent, mide/late 2023 or early 2024

   - Note to self: remember one or two of the authors and where they are from, instead of some vague stupid impression of what kind of plots were in the paper. The AI and search is still not that good yet.
