20241006, 11:35 pm: This is my first time trying to automate the weekly OFS process.
- The media is scrapped properly, but the link inside the tweets are not yet processed properly
- There are still quite some duplicates and extra tweets. Not fixing these yet since the whole thing might get re-generated again.



1. Microplastics? No no no, it's micro pig kidney, processed with micro dicer and micro grater made with DRIE (Bosch process).
Stuff like this really makes me wonder how many interesting things are waiting to be done across multiple research fields.

   - From
Microdissection tools to generate organoids for modeling the tumor immune microenvironment https://nature.com/articles/s41378-024-00756-8…
and
Fabrication of a silicon μDicer for uniform microdissection of tissue samples https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/119/1/011904/40233…
They made everything open including process params.

2. Things always get weird on the wavelength scale... TIL that if you make your laser beam radially polarized, you could focus it 2x more than linearly polarized, and it generates a longitudinal E field at the focus that contains most of the power, ideal for accelerating electrons.

   - The polarization state is generated by putting a rotated Brewster angle polarizer inside your laser cavity, and it could work both reflectively or refractively.

   - The nice plots of the radial and axial E field is from Focusing of high numerical aperture cylindrical-vector beams(https://opg.optica.org/oe/abstract.cfm?uri=OE-7-2-77…). They showed the more you focus, the stronger axial field you get at the focus. People dream about it generating electron-positron pairs.

   - And people have measured and showed that the tight focus and axial field is real. Screenshots from https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.91.233901….

   - I used to think (and still do to some extent) that many of the OAM (orbital angular momentum) beam is bs especially for communication, I guess there are weird effects that are just beyond the gaussian beam picture.

   - 4pi focused laser pulse, damn that's a new one for me (and 0.073 lambda^3, that's comparable to a silicon 1D photonic crystal cavity, with no two-photon absorption or rbeakdown limit..
   - sounds like a fun project, you only need a pile of cover glass to polarize it (?), maybe I’ll start with some simulation first

3. Today's rabbit hole: DE-STARLITE: a directed energy planetary defense mission.
Equipped with 100 kW MegaFlex PV arrays and 1 m diameter laser phased array, it heats the surface of hazardous asteroids to ~ 3,000 K so that the asteroid itself becomes the "propellant".

4. Me: afraid of burning fiber connectors and components with a 1 W EYDFA.
Biblically accurate phase coherent fiber laser array (from Optonicus):
   - There's not much info about it because it's funded by darpa and ARL. There are similar stuff from other people like these:

   - Yes. They call it adaptive fiber optics collimator (AFOC). Here is one example: (https://spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/5895/58950R/Design-of-adaptive-fiber-optics-collimator-for-free-space-communication/10.1117/12.618513.short#_=_…

8. Never though I'd ever see extremely bad cavity in a paper title about laser. Turns out it is relevant for active optical clock (AOC). You get most of the benefit of a laser cavity (higher power, narrower linewidth), and the laser is more robust against environmental fluctuations.

10. I knew lab-on-a-chip, optics/photonics-on-a-chip, and chip scale atomic clock. Today I ran into a paper about heart-on-a-chip and found out there is a whole genre of organ-on-a-chip, including heart, brain, lung, liver, gut...

11. The real sweet electronics is the edible electronics

12. You've probably heard about optical tweezers, but what about optoelectronic tweezers?
Shinning shaped light onto a photoconductive layer generates local electric field. The E field then could polarize and move particles and cells around, at 1e5 less power than optical tweezers.

   - This method is explored at Xerox PARC for micro-assembly of chiplets where they'd be too small (10 um to few hundred um) for pick and place. The chiplets start in a dielectric fluid randomly, and then get sorted and moved in place with OET & rolled onto a substrate.

14. And a master thesis on See Through Walls with Wi-Fi. I’m gonna start calling myself an inverse synthetic aperture. https://mit.edu/~fadel/papers/Fadel_MS.pdf…

15. One thing I found mind breaking yesterday and today is that, ink jet printing can be faster than FIVE METER PER SECOND.
Consumer level functional metarial ink jet printer when? (e.g. print CuO nanoparticles then reduce & sinter with laser to get conductive lines)
