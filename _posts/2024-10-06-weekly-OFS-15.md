20241006, 11:35 pm: This is my first time trying to automate the weekly OFS process.
- The media is scrapped properly, but the link inside the tweets are not yet processed properly
- There are still quite some duplicates and extra tweets. Not fixing these yet since the whole thing might get re-generated again.
- 20241013, 10:45 pm, I finished the cleanup!



1. Microplastics? No no no, it's micro pig kidney, processed with micro dicer and micro grater made with DRIE (Bosch process).
Stuff like this really makes me wonder how many interesting things are waiting to be done across multiple research fields.

   - From
[Microdissection tools to generate organoids for modeling the tumor immune microenvironment](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41378-024-00756-8)
and
[Fabrication of a silicon ŒºDicer for uniform microdissection of tissue samples](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/119/1/011904/40233). They made everything open including process params.

2. Things always get weird on the wavelength scale... TIL that if you make your laser beam radially polarized, you could focus it 2x more than linearly polarized, and it generates a longitudinal E field at the focus that contains most of the power, ideal for accelerating electrons.

   - The polarization state is generated by putting a rotated Brewster angle polarizer inside your laser cavity, and it could work both reflectively or refractively.

   - The nice plots of the radial and axial E field is from [Focusing of high numerical aperture cylindrical-vector beams](https://opg.optica.org/oe/abstract.cfm?uri=OE-7-2-77). They showed the more you focus, the stronger axial field you get at the focus. People dream about it generating electron-positron pairs.
   ![20240924_005712_0.jpg](/assets/images/2024/20240803_20240928/20240924_005712_0.jpg)

   - And people have measured and showed that the tight focus and axial field is real. Screenshots from [Sharper Focus for a Radially Polarized Light Beam](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.91.233901).
(The pair generation figure above is from [Effects of Colliding Laser Pulses Polarization on ùëí‚àí‚Å¢ùëí+ Cascade Development in Extreme Focusing](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.133.125001). I'm dumping all the links here so that I could find them later.)

   - I used to think (and still do to some extent) that many of the OAM (orbital angular momentum) beam is bs especially for communication, I guess there are weird effects that are just beyond the gaussian beam picture. Anyway here is a nice open access review: [Cylindrical vector beams: from mathematical concepts to applications](https://opg.optica.org/aop/fulltext.cfm?uri=aop-1-1-1&id=176226)

3. Today's rabbit hole: DE-STARLITE: a directed energy planetary defense mission.
Equipped with 100 kW MegaFlex PV arrays and 1 m diameter laser phased array, it heats the surface of hazardous asteroids to ~ 3,000 K so that the asteroid itself becomes the "propellant".
![20240925_011620_0.jpg](/assets/images/2024/20240803_20240928/20240925_011620_0.jpg)

   - It is a LITE version of their original DE-STAR proposal, they would like 140 GW of solar power from 10 km x 10 km solar array. Even if it's only 10 um thick it would already weight 3,000 tons, and 70 GW of fiber lasers would be another 7,000 tons.
   ![20240925_012944_0.jpg](/assets/images/2024/20240803_20240928/20240925_012944_0.jpg)

   - Lol they built a lab prototype. Sounds like they really had a lot of fun with it: "When we fire the laser at a target, we do indeed create an extremely intense white hot spot that lights up the room and vaporizes every material we have tried."
   ![20240925_013357_0.jpg](/assets/images/2024/20240803_20240928/20240925_013357_0.jpg)

   - They mentioned many other potential applications including shooting stuff up from the ground with the laser, and beaming the power down to the ground with microwave or mmw...

   - Also found this histogram of SEM images for two projects lol. x axis is which hour of the day the images were taken.
As well as the evolution of time needed to take one SEM image (navigate around & focus the beam etc. From file creation time so pbb not accurate)

8. Never though I'd ever see extremely bad cavity in a paper title about laser. Turns out it is relevant for active optical clock (AOC). You get most of the benefit of a laser cavity (higher power, narrower linewidth), and the laser is more robust against environmental fluctuations.
![20240926_013545_0.jpg](/assets/images/2024/20240803_20240928/20240926_013545_0.jpg)

   - Most people probably have only worked with finesse expression for high reflectivity r. Turns out when r is very low, the usual approximation is off and would predict F = 0, while the actual minimal F = 2. That's why they made the plot of log10(F-2) to show how bad their cavity is
   ![20240926_014241_0.jpg](/assets/images/2024/20240803_20240928/20240926_014241_0.jpg)

   - Screenshots from [An extremely bad-cavity laser](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-024-00880-3)
and [Antiresonant Fabry-P√©rot cavity with ultralow finesse](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.107.023517)
   - Mirrorless laser is also a thing. The basic idea of how it could exist is, if the gain is high enough or the gain medium long enough, the spontaneously emitted photons from one end could get amplified enough and coherent enough, and you get much narrower and more intense emission
   ![20240926_015131_0.jpg](/assets/images/2024/20240803_20240928/20240926_015131_0.jpg)

   - From [Threshold characteristics of mirrorless lasers](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-abstract/48/1/256/8972/Threshold-characteristics-of-mirrorless-lasers) (open [ver.](https://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1065&context=ece_fac))
   - How much benefit do they get from extremely bad mirrors (R = 0.485%)? The linewidth reduced from a gain BW of 7 MHz to 280 kHz when it goes above threshold while still mirrorless, and then further reduced to 1.2 kHz after adding the mirror. Meanwhile the cavity LW is 438 MHz.
   ![20240926_020659_0.jpg](/assets/images/2024/20240803_20240928/20240926_020659_0.jpg)

   - This cavity LW is surprising to me, it is still really high Q. I'd do my best for my on-chip photonic crystal cavities and the LW would rarely be this good. Their cavity must be huge... wait it is actually only 17 cm.. (and they need high transmission coating lol)

9. I knew lab-on-a-chip, optics/photonics-on-a-chip, and chip scale atomic clock. Today I ran into a paper about heart-on-a-chip and found out there is a whole genre of organ-on-a-chip, including heart, brain, lung, liver, gut...

   - I was looking into the LUMOS program (Lasers for Universal Microscale Optical Systems) trying to find some images for cool photonics chips, and found that there's some recent development: [Nexus Photonics to Commercialize DARPA LUMOS Technologies](https://www.nexusphotonics.com/news/nexus-photonics-to-commercialize-darpa-lumos-technologies)
Also google scholar is surprisingly good at searching by award id.

10. You've probably heard about optical tweezers, but what about optoelectronic tweezers?
Shinning shaped light onto a photoconductive layer generates local electric field. The E field then could polarize and move particles and cells around, at 1e5 less power than optical tweezers.

   - This method is explored at Xerox PARC for micro-assembly of chiplets where they'd be too small (10 um to few hundred um) for pick and place. The chiplets start in a dielectric fluid randomly, and then get sorted and moved in place with OET & rolled onto a substrate.

13. This is sick. You might remember the work using wifi to image people behind walls, now they showed you can sense breathing with wifi. 20 dB more SNR you‚Äôll pbb be able to sense heart rate!

   - And a master thesis on [See Through Walls with Wi-Fi](https://www.mit.edu/~fadel/papers/Fadel_MS.pdf). I‚Äôm gonna start calling myself an inverse synthetic aperture.

14. One thing I found mind breaking yesterday and today is that, ink jet printing can be faster than FIVE METER PER SECOND.
Consumer level functional metarial ink jet printer when? (e.g. print CuO nanoparticles then reduce & sinter with laser to get conductive lines)

Printer: Epson EcoTank L805, < $500 used, could directly print on CD/DVD, which is how they mount their substrate
Droplet spot 40~70 um
Alignment accuracy ~ 10 um
