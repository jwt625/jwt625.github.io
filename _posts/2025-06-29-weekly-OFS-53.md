# Cavity-integrated electro-optics circuits

some nice photonic and microwave circuits from the Cavity-Integrated Electro-Optics (CIELO) project

(and also the flip-chip HBAR)

femtosecond laser-assisted wet etching

# Microwave cavity resonance tuning

i love and hate this

(using screws to tune the resonance of a 3d microwave cavity)

   - a while ago i thought it would be better than brass screws to use PTFE screws with aluminum tips for tuning, so that everything the field sees would still be superconducting
   - horrible idea, did not work well

# DIY planar ion trap

7000 bucks and you could make your own planar ion trap with similar working principles as used for a trapped ion quantum computer
the circuit part is about one grand, and most of the rest is going to SRS (Stanford Research Systems) and Edmund Optics

# Integrated photonic tensor processor

integrated photonics–based tensor optical processor that is "hypermultiplexed" in wavelength, spatial, and time domain
inputs and weights are modulated light from VCSEL, and thru the EOMs on the chip, and sum is done in time domain using a charge integrating amplifier

wish they showed more of the actual setup. Also need to look into the energy numbers more, some claims are a bit confusing/misleading

   - MZMs / MZIs only look like this when they are really stressed out
   - (a lot of wiggles likely backreflections from the rest of the circuits, also what kind of fit is this, why is the curvature sharper near the bottom..)

# Semiconductor fabrication insights

i like it when companies show you the actual stuff they are building and making

(usually when they are not too big)
