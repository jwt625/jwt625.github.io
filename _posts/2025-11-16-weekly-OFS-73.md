damn how small can you make these

# Optoelectronic computing with CMOS image sensors

if anyone is going to make optical/photonic computing work and win, it's going to be a marriage between the microLED/VCSEL array folks, and the lockin camera folks. it's not going to be using modulators from telecom folks, nor SLM/DMD from display folks. You need someone that cares about every single photon, and every single electron, and those people are doing sensing at the edge like ToF cameras starved with low power consumption.
![20251111_050437_0.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20241227_20251117/20251111_050437_0.jpg)
   - this paper made me realize i should be looking into optoelectronic devices for sensing more. Everyone will use the same trick of optical fan-out, and MAC in time domain to reduce spatial complexity. How do you win? You win by caring about every electron you use for the modulation, and every photon for the detection. Na2025: [Implementation of transformer-based LLMswith large-scale optoelectronic neurons on aCMOS image sensor platform]( https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04136)
   ![20251111_051038_0.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20241227_20251117/20251111_051038_0.jpg)
   - it's kind of sad how little the role of the photons is playing, it's really just carrying the info as they are always destined to do, and the compute is done by the detector and demodulator, which is named by the ToF camera folks, and is basically a cmos switch right next to the detector pixel.
   ![20251111_051900_0.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20241227_20251117/20251111_051900_0.jpg)
   <!-- - nice one tho i said it's not gonna be using SLM -->
   <!-- - doing lockin at every pixel, not common, blew my mind when i first saw it -->
   <!-- - i never used one. just looks amazing.. -->

# Light-driven tactile displays

some tactile displays are basically violence at mini/micro scale, theres this one by heating up tiny photoabsorbers up to 550 C inside tiny gas cells/pixels so the pixels expand, and there are ones using micro combustion. i like this light absorbers based one.
![20251112_055940_0.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20241227_20251117/20251112_055940_0.jpg)

   - i guess you cant keep it on for too long it's gonna burn your finger, they've been keeping the pulse short (< 50 ms) and low duty cycle (10%)
   ![20251112_060554_0.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20241227_20251117/20251112_060554_0.jpg)

   - this is the micro explosion/combustion based one, what a headache to operate, even requires tiny spark gaps for each pixel!

# High harmonic generation with mid-IR lasers

this is actually a fascinating process, and it's 10+ years old, and the longer wavelength your pump is, the shorter wavelength the HHG could go. I've never seen above 5000x HHG before...
![20251112_074736_0.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20241227_20251117/20251112_074736_0.jpg)

# Parametric amplifier isolator

# Thermal design automation for 3D ICs

compact thermal model and thermal design automation of 3D integrated circuits and external cooling

   - the interfacial thermal resistance and phonon transport are much more complicated than you'd expect. Like i was not expecting seeing phonon density of state. There are quite some first principle modeling works. Cao2025: [Thermal design automation (TDA) for multiscale thermal management of electronics]( https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0288828)

   - think thermal is just diffusion? naive! it's just a special simplified case of boltzmann transport equation. (tho diffusion should cover most of the cases, and BTE is so general it could probably describe your dating experience)

      - Updated [3dgs viewer](https://github.com/jwt625/3dgs-viewer) to include 3rd order SH
      - setup and played with `kimi k2 thinking`, it barely runs on 8xH100.
      - Continued [DocEater](https://github.com/jwt625/DocEater)
         - started parsing all safe pdfs in my download folder. Actually as I type here (Sun Nov  9 23:28:59 PST 2025) it just finished the first pass:

<pre><code>================================================================================

================================================================================
</code></pre>
   - week 71: Continued [DocEater](https://github.com/jwt625/DocEater)
      - ran lint and type checks, tested all APIs.
   - week 65: Added more analysis to [bay bridge traffic](https://github.com/jwt625/bay-bridge-traffic-cam)
      - should really continue one-click-paper-page!
   - week 63:
      - Continuing [one click web paper](https://github.com/jwt625/PlayGround/tree/main/20250831_one_click_paper_page). Got actual deployment working. Had to refactor backend etc.
      - Also added traffic speed to [Bay Bridge traffic](https://bay-bridge-traffic.com). The repo was spun off from PlayGround last weekend iirc.
      ![BBT-speed](/assets/images/2025/BBT-speed.png)
   - week 62: [one click web paper](https://github.com/jwt625/PlayGround/tree/main/20250831_one_click_paper_page)

      - ![BBT-dashbpard](/assets/images/2025/20240926_20250811/BBT-20250810.png)
      - https://bay-bridge-traffic.com
      - I think it is already getting hit hard and slowing down the detection, might have to take this down
      - nope not really getting hit hard, not sure what it was, added some rate limiting and restarted things, now back to 30 fps most of the time
   - week 58: Bay bridge traffic tracker
      - [tweet](https://x.com/jwt0625/status/1952093334476095643)
