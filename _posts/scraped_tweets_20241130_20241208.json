However, this 0.2 nm size strontium atom could also be captured with not so crazy optics (50 mm lens) & exposure time, which means it has very high scattering cross section to \"reflect\" the blue-violet light illumination. It also appears huge because of the smaller NA of the camera (separation of the two ion trap metal tip is 2 mm).\n\nTurns out the scattering cross section of an atom on-resonance is comparable to the wavelength if you go thru the physics and math (3λ^2/3pi), and you can observe very similar wavelength-scale radar cross section on a tiny subwavelength rf/microwave antenna as well, fully passive.\n\nHere I looked at a ~1.5 mm dipole antenna, resonant at 3.46 GHz, i.e., its size is ~1/60 wavelength, and its on-resonance RCS is almost x1e6 of off-resonance RCS).\n\nSimilar to Chu–Harrington limit of antenna Q, this is a very general rule for any passive scatterer of size within a sphere of radius a << λ: its max RCS is ~λ^2, independent of its size. You could have a very high-Q atom scattering light as if it is as big as ~1 um, and you could build a tiny passive rf antenna that \"looks huge\" on-resonance (it has to be low internal loss).",

However, this 0.2 nm size strontium atom could also be captured with not so crazy optics (50 mm lens) & exposure time, which means it has very high scattering cross section to \"reflect\" the blue-violet light illumination. It also appears huge because of the smaller NA of the camera (separation of the two ion trap metal tip is 2 mm).\n\nTurns out the scattering cross section of an atom on-resonance is comparable to the wavelength if you go thru the physics and math (3λ^2/3pi), and you can observe very similar wavelength-scale radar cross section on a tiny subwavelength rf/microwave antenna as well, fully passive.\n\nHere I looked at a ~1.5 mm dipole antenna, resonant at 3.46 GHz, i.e., its size is ~1/60 wavelength, and its on-resonance RCS is almost x1e6 of off-resonance RCS).\n\nSimilar to Chu–Harrington limit of antenna Q, this is a very general rule for any passive scatterer of size within a sphere of radius a << λ: its max RCS is ~λ^2, independent of its size. You could have a very high-Q atom scattering light as if it is as big as ~1 um, and you could build a tiny passive rf antenna that \"looks huge\" on-resonance (it has to be low internal loss).",

They have been constantly updating and expanding the multiphysics, tutorials, application library and material library etc etc, and each update has meaningful capability & user experience improvement.\n\nTake the mesh on periodic boundary condition (PBC) surfaces as an example for the user experience: \n- In 5.0 - 5.4 you need to manually mesh one surface and copy to another surface to make sure the mesh is identical on the pairs of surfaces (so that the PBC would work properly).\n- Since 5.6 or so, the automatically generated mesh starts to take care of this, and when you've run it once and then switch to manual, you'll see the auto-added surface mesh + copy.\n- Since 6.2 iirc, now you could have an \"identical mesh\" constraint on the pair of surfaces, and mesh them at any order you like, more flexible than meshing them separately first.\n- I could personally come up a few more examples like this.\n\nIt still sucks every now and then, and there are things that need a lot of manual/scripted setup or impossible. But the list for these things has been shrinking, and there is a growing list of stuff that used to take a phd journey to figure out and setup properly, but now is just one of the physics or multiphysics settings.",

Ok maybe the rate and fidelity are low?\nThen I saw they made them upto 33 kHz and 94% in 2020. My last guess would be yield... and voila, \"typical yield of around 0.9%\"",
