# 800G/400G Coherent Transceiver Chip Designs  

800G receiver chip (2x FR4, you can see two big arrayed waveguide gratings (AWG) for the demux)
and
400G transmitter chip (four SOAs die bonded, one AWG, and a ring resonator? Fast modulation signals coming from the left, and bias signals from the right).
From [Super Photonics Xiamen](http://superphotonics-ic.com/en_product.aspx), acquired my POET recently.

# Modular Photonic Quantum Computer Architecture  

"Modular photonic quantum computer" fresh off the press.

35 photonics chips, 84 squeezers, 36 photon number resolving detectors, synthesizing a giant cluster state (highly entangled) with 7e9 temporal modes x 12 physical modes. I'm illiterate in these quantum algo, all I desire is cheap squeezers and detectors.

Still a sad loss of 14 dB from squeezer to detector. They have a nice breakdown of all the losses, and lasers used (non of the lasers are integrated yet).

# Positronium Laser Cooling and Biomedical Applications 

TIL there is an "element" that is even simpler than a hydrogen atom: positronium, made of an electron and a positron (antiparticle of electron), and you can do all the usual AMO tricks on it such as laser cooling.
First reaction: oh neat, fancy toy for high energy physicists. But it actually has biomedical applications such as imaging cancer cells.
![20250123_212713_0.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20241113_20250130/20250123_212713_0.jpg)

   - The lifetime depend on the states, p-Ps is 0.1 ns and o-Ps (symmetry protected and could only decay to three photons) is 142 ns, and could be much longer in Rydberg states

# Green Ammonia Synthesis from Atmospheric Components  

Haber-Bosch? You can get ammonia straight from thin air, and it's greeen.
(only 0.05 grams/hour though)
![20250124_174901_0.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20241113_20250130/20250124_174901_0.jpg)

# 270 km Ultralong Raman Fiber Laser

TIL the longest laser so far is a 270 km Raman fiber laser, and the corresponding FSR or mode spacing is only 380 Hz.
If you lift it up vertically the gravitational redshift would be more than the FSR 

(I don't get it though as the ~1450 nm pump would have decayed so much, and faster than the ~1550 nm lasing modes, and there's no ticks on the log scale plot)
![20250125_012049_0.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20241113_20250130/20250125_012049_0.jpg)
   - Turitsyn2009: [270-km Ultralong Raman Fiber Laser](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.103.133901)

   - I have no good sense of the sensitivity vs fiber length/turns. They do have to use lower and lower power for longer fiber to avoid washing out the modes with "turbulentlike phase shifts induced by nonlinear interactions of multiple waves with different frequencies"

# Dirac Cone Engineering in Superconducting Circuits

   - Nice statistics for Q. Better not use amorphous Si for dielectrics if you want higher Q.

# Single-Electron Resolution in Quanta Image Sensors  

You might think our daily life is still far from the world of quantum, atoms and electrons, but sota security CMOS camera is not that far from counting single photons (read noise ~< 0.3 electron rms).
When you do it's called a quanta image sensor (QIS), and you can resolve single photons and single electrons for both your signal and for the dark current.

# Liquid Crystal Polarization Grating Beam Steering

This [liquid crystal and polarization grating based beam steering](https://meadowlark.com/lcpg-principles/) is actually pretty neat: non-mechanical, large number of spots (> 1k), large aperture (> 20 cm??), high efficiency, ms switching time, N digital controls for 2^N spots (look at you, phased array), and although dispersive but can pick a wavelength from VIS to MWIR... What's the catch, cycle time? operational temperature?

   - How it works: just a stack of two components:
   - A liquid crystal half wave plate to switch between left and right hand circularly polarized light, and a polarization grating with linearly varying birefringence to scatter the light either left or right based

# CCD-Based Moiré Metrology Techniques 

Moiré pattern/method is used to measure position/strain/surface deformation etc., and it involves "mixing" of two spatially periodic patterns just like in frequency domain: homodyne/heterodyne detection, a lock-in, or an RF mixer.
You could also use the periodic pattern of the CCD pixels as a known "LO" to achieve it instead of an external one.

   - This paper is a joy to read, their recipe is better than some aspects nanofab process lol, controlling the starch content to within +-1%. And also very detailed SI.

# Historical Magnetic Core Memory Architecture

The drive frame of IBM's 32,000-word magnetic-core memory, April 1957.
They call each set of eight-tube unit a pluggable unit.

# Lunar Laser Ranging Link Budgets

届かない恋

(S11 of a laser moon bounce is about -160 dB. Saw a talk yesterday of a lunar earth FSO link with free space propagation loss of -276 dB.)

The moon is so much brighter you have to pulse and do temporal filtering.

   - I should have said it's theory / budget survey, I guess at least it shows they believe it's doable.
