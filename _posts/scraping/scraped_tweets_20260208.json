Woollam - Ellipsometry Tutorial]( https://www.jawoollam.com/resources/ellipsometry-tutorial) I've spent countless sessions on such tool measuring TFLN thickness taht I could probably yap for a while on its calibration, fit recipes, optimizing the incident angles, optical anisotropy and Euler angles of your model etc. Also the software/GUI sucks.",

The ellipsometry angles are chosen to be around the brewster angles because you'll see it blow up and be sensitive to film thickness.
