There is also good news that there are actual examples of large scale cryogenic systems, LHC's total cooling power at 4 K is > 100 kW. The bad news is that the Coefficient of Performance (COP) is worse than 1:200, and that is even with a centralized He refrigeration plant, dilfridges' number is worse than 1:4000. Let's be gentle and assume we can mod dilfridge with centralized He plant and get 1:500, and get 1000 qubits under a 2 W @ 4 K plate, and we get 1 W facility power per qubit for cooling. They assumed 1:1500, so it's probably going to end up being 1~10 W/qubit.",

(they had to reduce the exposed waveguide to as short as 100 um just to feel something) well if you think the other way, this would be a great Rb vapor density sensor, and if you could shoot laser at the pill to dispense Rb, you could probably also shoot laser thru the waveguide to cause desorption of the Rb thats onto the waveguide surface. hence their followup work did exactly these, a desorption laser thru the waveguide almost completely got rid of the Rb induced loss, and monitoring the propagation loss during the Rb pill activation lets them develop various weaker and fancier activation pulse sequences to target different Rb vapor densities.",

                "text": "before my lithium niobate (LN) appreciation thread, i gotta trash talk about it one more time: pyroelectric effect. as the name suggests, you get electric field from temperature change (but not vice versa as would be the case for a lot of other effects since here entropy is involved. The other direction is electrocaloric effect). This means you can do cool stuff with it, such as rapid heating of a chip to get 100 kV ( https://x.com/jwt0625/status/1806362394639372773), but it also means a lot of horrible unexpected stuff could happen if you don't know about it. when you bake your chip during fab on a hotplate, the electric field from the temperature change could fry the devices, or even fry and crack the whole substrate. People would add conductive coating or even wrap the chip in aluminum foil during processing to provide discharge paths. And of course it's dependent on crystal cut, and usually worse on z-cut. You'll find literature from the 1980s complaining about channel waveguide MZI drifting more on z-cut LN ( https://doi.org/10.1063/1.96640). here is another example where electric field from a LN chip ESD-ed a device on *another* chip during cooldown to 4 K ( https://x.com/jwt0625/status/1806362394639372773). They have to add shielding electrodes to protect those devices and they would survive, and the IDTs on LN chip would still get fried. pyroelectric effect also bothered me a few times, and I was not even on z-cut. I had some x-cut thin film LN devices on silicon substrate, mostly released (i.e. floating) with a few anchor points, that suddenly started mysteriously collapsing when cooling down to 4 K. I ruled out CTE mismatch because that won't explain why it suddenly started happening, but it could be pyroelectric + electrostatic pull-in because I may have moved to a new wafer with better crystal quality and worse discharge. So I put extra aluminum electrodes everywhere to short different LN components to the silicon substrate, and they stopped the collapse..",

Firmware encodes the event, and a microcontroller emits a USB or Bluetooth HID report of a few dozen bytes. the OS services an interrupt in a few us, maps scan codes to characters, and updates 10²~10³ bytes of state in DRAM, stored as charge from ~10⁸ electrons on capacitors refreshed every ~60 ms. your browser constructs an HTTPS request of 1~5 kB, which the TCP/IP stack segments into ~1.5 kB payloads matched to the Ethernet MTU. These drive a network interface with SerDes operating at a few GHz, shoving 10⁶~10⁸ electrons per bit. electrical signals propagate a few cm across copper traces, then drive optical transceivers where electrons jump a semiconductor bandgap to emit 10⁶~10⁸ photons per bit at telecom wavelengths. These photons traverse access, metro, and backbone networks, undergoing a dozen electrical <-> optical conversions at endpoints and regeneration sites. these photons might further go through hundreds to thousands of kilometers of fiber, amplified every ~100 km by erbium-doped fiber amplifiers via stimulated emission, wavelength-routed by ROADMs, might even bounce off google's MEMS optical circuit switches a few times, and eventually reconverted to electrons by photodiodes at termination and routing boundaries. at the data center, packets are reassembled and delivered to inference servers where GPUs perform matrix multiplications involving ~10¹² model parameters over milliseconds, with transistors toggling at 10¹⁶~10¹⁷ times per second. those parameters were produced earlier by training runs lasting weeks to months, using ~10⁴ accelerators drawing who knows how many megawatts of power, shoving 10³⁰~10³³ electrons through transistor channels for the 10²³~10²⁵ floating-point operations. the inference result is serialized into kilobytes of data and transmitted back through the same chain, again undergoing repeated electrical - optical - electrical conversions across access, metro, and backbone networks. back on your phone or laptop or whatever, the browser parses the response, updates layout and rendering structures, and issues GPU draw calls that write millions of pixels per frame into a framebuffer at 60~120 Hz. display interfaces stream multiple gigabits per second to an OLED or microLED panel, where the pixels emit roughly 10⁸~10¹¹ visible photons per frame, driven by ~microamp currents over ~microsecond switching intervals. those photons traverse a few meters in nanoseconds, absorbed by your retinal photoreceptors, transduced into electrochemical signals, and interpreted by a ~20 W biological neural system. end-to-end, you have astronomical numbers of highly coordinated electrons and photons, and dozens of conversions between them (ofc not including training), for a single thought from the little intelligence to appear on a screen and read by you.",
