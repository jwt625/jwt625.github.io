So don't get fooled, fiber is still much much better in propagation length in wavelengths, or quality factor Q.\nIf you run the numbers, the Q for a telecom fiber at 1.55 um is 130 billion... If a superconducting qubit has this Q, its T1 would be four seconds instead of few hundred microseconds. A microwave photon would be able to live in the superconducting cable for ~100 us, comparable to the best SC qubits.\n\nAlso the spool of cable takes a whopping one week to thermalize... Maybe they should pot most of it in stycast lol.",

This means its noise figure and nonlinearities are also on par with EDFAs.\n\nFunny the waveguide gets doped and annealed so hard it no longer looks like a rectangle lol.\n\nQAM: quadrature amplitude modulation\nWDM: wavelength division multiplexing\nPDM: polarization-division multiplexing",
