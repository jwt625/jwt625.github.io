Some phased array lidars have a few thousands of components. Lightmatter's Passage M1000 likely will have few tens of thousands, it's so big you could get max 12 or 13 per 12 in wafer, and thats very roughly 100 bucks just from the price of the SOI wafer..\n\nI'm derailing too much. I'm just a bit sad that a random person can't buy a SiPho chip as affordable and useful as IC chips from 50 years ago. What you can buy that are close to SiPho are old transceivers, maybe the first step is to figure out something fun with them.",
