Even the indicators on the wall were blinking in perfect sync, one in red and one in green. i didnt have time to record any of this, i didnt even realize what i just experienced until i was already in one of them. idk what else to say i just felt like this is such a rare event without any coordination that i have to write something about it. it's like getting a coincidence count in a heralded entanglement swapping experiment without compensating for a random delay, and it also reminds me that if you want to release and later catch a pulse with a qubit perfectly, you gotta tune its coupling rate in time to symmetrize the pulse shape in time as well.",

And then you start appreciating dissipations, nonlinearities, and chaos more. You could always add more layers to explain and unexplain more things simultaneously. You'll keep adding more kinds of energies to keep or break the old but new theorems. same for learning or understanding, aren't you always starting with simulating the understanding, and you do it frequent and long enough it becomes natural enough so that you feel comfortable calling it understood? If you keep operating this English version of the program and it slowly becomes your muscle memory, I say you understand Chinese now. You work in the Chinese room and you'll understand Chinese.
