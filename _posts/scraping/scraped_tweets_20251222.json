The best you can take advantage of is the extra flexibility and degrees of freedom. Once you start seeing this, it becomes natural to pair it with SLMs, and you end up with a massively parallel and reconfigurable array of beams. this configuration also has more relaxed requirements on alignment, writefield stitching etc during the fab process, it's so nice, probably also much easier to mass produce with nanoimprint.",
