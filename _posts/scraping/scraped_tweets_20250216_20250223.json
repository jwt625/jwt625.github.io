As the name suggests, it probably works by the laser beam blowing off the foil that was blocking the beam. Can't find much about it..",

Nope it is actually a piezoelectric antenna for VLF (3-30 kHz, or 10-100 km wavelength) without being huge, by using a mechanical resonance of a lithium niobate rod.\n\n(well the voltage gets as high as 125 kV so it still looks like a Tesla coil discharging)\n\nWhile it cannot cheat the antenna Chu-Harrington limit (yet?) so that the radiation Q is very high (~1e13), the mechanical Q~5e5 is much higher than what you would get with the electical version (Q~1000), so they claim it is relatively 300x more efficient. They also used direct antenna modulation (DAM) to cheat the Bode-Fano, and got 83x higher bandwidth (7 Hz vs 80 mHz).\n\nThe catch? The peak power dissipation is ~ 1 W before the crystal rod shatters, and only 2e-7 of this 1 W is radiated..",
