This is a placeholder for the shed project I started with my friend Bryan in his backyard during Christmas 2023 and the new year. I plan to work on writing this up in the next three weeks (today is 2024/06/23).

Jesus Christ it is 2025/04/20 today, 10 months later.. You procrastinating piece of [redacted]. Ok let's get started.

My friend and I were doing this scale of wood work for the first time. We felt confident enough after some youtube videos as well as a book from Larry Haun ([How to Build a House](https://www.amazon.com/Habitat-Humanity-How-Build-House/dp/1561585327)), and we just head to home depot with some hand drawn layout.

Overall this shed took us roughly 15 days from start to finish (scattered over Christmas & new year, and a few more weekends).


# Foundation

The foundation will be gravels with [concrete deck blocks](https://www.homedepot.com/pep/10-3-4-in-x-10-3-4-in-x-7-3-4-in-Concrete-Deck-Block-100002709/204827028) on top, and then pressure treated 2x6.
- the high level plan is to have a 8 ft by 8 ft shed, with a 4 ft by 8 ft deck in front of the entrance.

- idiots in cars episode 1 lol

Digging:

    <img src="/assets/images/2025/shed/IMG_2415.JPG" alt="fill-gravel" style="max-width: 48%; object-fit: contain;"/>
</div>

Measuring everything to be square and level is tricky. There is a slight gradient, and we have to adjust the gravels and blocks multiple times.

</div>
- Dispite trying all the proper things (measuring all sides, measuring diagonals etc), the front of the shed still came 2 in or so short of the back side. This caused a lot of pain later.

After a day, we got all the joists of the foundation.

- if you look closely you can see spacers under some beams lol. We did also mess up the leveling a bit


# Floor & Wall Framing

Not much to say, typical framing. The incline we decided for the roof turns out to be a bit too steep.

    <img src="/assets/images/2025/shed/IMG_2438.JPG" alt="framing-2" style="max-width: 48%; object-fit: contain;"/>
</div>
- We got the two side wall and the back wall done in one day
- one of the side wall has a window, and that shifted the studs around a bit.

It took few trips to get all the framing materials, as well as OSBs and insulations for the floor

</div>
- the insulations are supported by one of the dumbest things I've seen (insulation support wires)
- in the right picture you could also see the angle of the foundation is off from 90 deg...
- the front wall in the left image is very heavy because of the header. My friend planned a wide sliding door. Then there are extra layers of studs (trimmer studs and king studs), as well as cripple studs for small windows above the door. It definitely takes two people to raise this wall.

- finally got the floor & framing done, felt super nice to actually sit inside
