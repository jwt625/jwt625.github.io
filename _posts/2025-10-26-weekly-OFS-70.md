# Tunable external cavity laser

   - no no im just taking photos of this laser with my phone, and the 3dgs is reconstructed from the photos. there are fancier scanners that use laser -->


# Inverse-designed grating coupler for silicon photonics

inverse designed grating coupler with ~ 1 dB coupling loss over ~25 nm bandwidth around c band for both polarizations. why do they cut off two corners of their SEM?

   - (there are clearly better grating couplers not in these tables with crazier fab process)
   <!-- - it's the nature of the coupler, the k vector of the wave needs to be bent/kicked by the structure from the free space k to the guided k, and that's done by the geometry of the structure and fixed, hence narrowband. the way to get wide bw is something either more adiabatic or more abrupt, like butt coupling, or tapered fiber. that said 25 nm is also already a lot of bw and could do a lot of things -->

# Lithium jet stripper for heavy ion beams

in case you need to know this, a 10~20 um thick lithium jet flowing at > 50 m/s can be stable and used for stripping electrons from high power heavy ion beams, where conventional thin carbon film stripper would die too fast.

# SAW resonator with metasurface for MIR detection

SAW resonator + metamarerial absorber for MIR detection. not crazy NEP but could probably get much better when cooled. they did not mention frequency domain multiplexing at all, you could totally build an imager just like MKIDs.

- Week 64: David's karaoke party. Also start taking the ferry routes every week. Should start a thread of something to log it.
- Week 61: Went to [Andy](https://x.com/oldestasian)'s dumpling dinner, [David](https://x.com/boxcardavid)'s Costco hotdog meetup, and [bubble boi](https://x.com/bubblebabyboi)'s hot chip Dolores park meetup

Planning:
- Writing:
   - cleanroom misc
      - week 66: I ordered a mic! Need to update inference endpoint for the voice transcriber..
   - [x] week 66: converted four old google docs to blog tutorials:
      - [piezoelectric eigen mode sim with different ES boundary on metal electrodes](/tutorial/piezoelectric-eigen-mode-sim-with-different-es-boundary-on-metal/)

- One-click web paper publishing: every time i see a pay walled paper i get pissed off. I should build something to help people publish their paper as their own website.


Ongoing:
- Playground:
   - week 65: Added more analysis to [bay bridge traffic](https://github.com/jwt625/bay-bridge-traffic-cam)
      - should really continue one-click-paper-page!
   - week 63:
      - Continuing [one click web paper](https://github.com/jwt625/PlayGround/tree/main/20250831_one_click_paper_page). Got actual deployment working. Had to refactor backend etc.
      - Also added traffic speed to [Bay Bridge traffic](https://bay-bridge-traffic.com). The repo was spun off from PlayGround last weekend iirc.
      ![BBT-speed](/assets/images/2025/BBT-speed.png)
   - week 62: [one click web paper](https://github.com/jwt625/PlayGround/tree/main/20250831_one_click_paper_page)
      - ![One-click-paper](/assets/images/2025/20240926_20250811/one-click-paper.png)

   - week 60: [scraping youtube liked video](https://github.com/jwt625/PlayGround/tree/main/20250816_youtube_liked)
   - week 59: "deployed" theBay Bridge traffic monitoring
      - inaccurate, unstable, and no guarantee on QoS, but anyway it is at bay-bridge-traffic dot com
      - ![BBT-dashbpard](/assets/images/2025/20240926_20250811/BBT-20250810.png)

      - I think it is already getting hit hard and slowing down the detection, might have to take this down
      - nope not really getting hit hard, not sure what it was, added some rate limiting and restarted things, now back to 30 fps most of the time

   - week 55: keep using it. Should consider start tracking different speakers. Should also consider concurrent tracking with browser activities
   - Week 53 & 54: got basic stuff working and used it to track one interview session with chatGPT voice mode. Also been using it to track youtube videos I watch
- [mouse & keystroke tracker](https://github.com/jwt625/PlayGround/tree/main/20250606_keyLogging)
   - week 1 (50): got basics working. Need to add chrome extension for more fine grained tracking
