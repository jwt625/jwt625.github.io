1. The nice rendering of the NIF fuel pellet/capsule holder got a cool flexure design. Turns out it is called thermomechanical packaging (TMP). Flexure is made of titanium & designed to apply pressure evenly.

3. Would you implant magnets into your arm to track the muscle deformation, to get more arms? It's quite comparable to sota approach (using surface electromyography (EMG) signals). It directly measures muscle length and velocity, thus potentially bidirectional and more accurate.

4. Stretchable versions of the Arduino Lilypad, SparkFun Sound Detector, SparkFun RGB and Gesture Sensor, made with oxidized gallium-indium (OGaIn) on VHB tape! They showed you can stretch them more than 400%, and made two inflatable blue and red cubes crawl and kiss each other

5. TIL there is a class of optimization algorithms inspired by how ant colonies function, and are good at solving problems \equiv finding good paths through graphs. Intuition: ants follow & leave pheromone. Shorter the path, ants travel more often -> stronger pheromone -> more ants.

- Originally found this type of algo from this paper: [Ant-colony optimization-based multi-input multi-output (ACO-MIMO) equalization for low-complexity mode-division multiplexing (MDM) processing](https://opg.optica.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-32-17-29943&id=554303)

7. Floyd–Steinberg dithering is an image dithering algorithm, which "intentionally applied form of noise used to randomize quantization error, preventing large-scale patterns such as color banding in images."
- Here is a photo of one of my favorite traffic sign after the dithering.

8. Micromachining for Optical and Optoelectronic Systems, aka, optical table on a chip. The most amazing step of erecting the optical elements, is done by stick-slip actuators, or scratch drive actuators (SDA) as how they called it.

- Stick slip actuators are common esp. for positioners that are going to extreme environment like vacuum/cryogenic. It relies on breaking the static friction. If your chair has wheels, try moving around without touching anything else, and you'll get it. (See also [A Review of Stick–Slip Nanopositioning Actuators](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-23853-1_1))
![stick_slip.png](/assets/images/2024/stick_slip.png)
- While it sounds hard to do on chip, what you need is literally a floating big piece of silicon with a cross section that looks like a pry bar, and just apply +- 150 V alternatively, it will start crawling forward. It could do 80nm per step at 8um/s, and push up a piece of quartz. (See [Scratch drive actuator with mechanical links for self-assembly of three-dimensional MEMS](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/557525))

- This thread is an appreciation post because some of these work led to MEMS optical switch and tunable attenuators, which made some of my projects 10x faster and easier.

9. Astrophysics papers always have crazy units like gigayear, megaparsec (one parsec is ~20 trillion miles), power spectral density spanning from GHz to quadrillion Hz, and peak power of 1e39 W (~ a trillion suns).

10. A few major differences between electrocaloric effect and thermoelectric effect is ceramic vs. semiconductor, E field vs. current, and cycling vs. "steady state". This rabbit hole started with a paper on photocaloric, then you find out theres electro/mechano/magnetocaloric effect.

- Previously I've seen a laser trapped nano-particle: capable of detecting 1e-20 newton and acceleration of 1e-7*g. They used it to detect the recoil from an 𝛼 decay (a single helium nucleus).
