# Thermoplastic microlens arrays

are those lego pieces?

("Surface grating coupler demonstrator developed by SABIC and Tyndall National Institute", the microlens array looks very similar to ones in old transceivers and fiber optic hdmi cables)

   - their grating couplers are one of the weirdest and coolest I've seen in a while. Also 40% efficiency from the backside of the chip, amazing.

# Ultrasound-induced embryo rotation

sad they used a fixed dead embryo.

imagine if it is alive, imagine if you were a young zebrafish, a newborn to this unknown world, and got put into a dark tank, and suddenly invisible forces start to squeeze you, and slowly rotate you 360 deg. I'd be so traumatized.

   - the rotation is from changing the amplitude/phase of the transducers. The reconstruction is done with a forward model and minimizing the deviation with gradient descent.

# Cloud laboratory test bed

AWS for laboratories? how much would you pay to run an experiment?

meanwhile we don't even have time sharing for $100k lasers in the same lab building
![20250810_032623_0.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20240926_20250811/20250810_032623_0.jpg)
   - [Intro to NSF Test Bed: Toward a Network of Programmable Cloud Laboratories (NSF PCL Test Bed)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=-94bp6zDi0w)
   - for some lab lasers it's possible (the ones expensive mainly because it's mode-locked, or tunable, or very stable & low noise etc), not that hard/expensive to pull some SMF across the building esp theres already space and risers for the telecom fibers.
   - hard part would be to get the labs and owners of the lasers to work together..
   - definitely some tough tradeoff between standardization, flexibility, and cost of operation. It will be like aws, you'll have a million different resource types, and you'll suffer writing yaml files

   - i need to update my mental model about wafer scale bonding, as well as their metrology, annealing temperature as low as 200 C? You can take acoustic microscope image of the whole wafer?
   - also the older papers have absolutely pornographic images of stacked dies

   - Quite some follow up works on multi-organ chips, this one is for drug toxicity testing:

   - seems like drug tests are the main motivation.
   - this one has a modular design, and has totally different submodule parts for different tissue types.

   - week 59: "deployed" theBay Bridge traffic monitoring
      - inaccurate, unstable, and no guarantee on QoS, but anyway it is at bay-bridge-traffic dot com
      - ![BBT-dashbpard](/assets/images/2025/20240926_20250811/BBT-20250810.png)
      - https://bay-bridge-traffic.com
      - I think it is already getting hit hard and slowing down the detection, might have to take this down
      - nope not really getting hit hard, not sure what it was, added some rate limiting and restarted things, now back to 30 fps most of the time
   - week 58: Bay bridge traffic tracker
      - [tweet](https://x.com/jwt0625/status/1952093334476095643)
