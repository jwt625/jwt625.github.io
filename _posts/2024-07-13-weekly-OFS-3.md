1. The [nanodumbbell](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.121.033603) can now be rotated vertically with a trapping laser and a spinning laser.
- PRL paper: [Long-Axis Spinning of an Optically Levitated Particle: A Levitated Spinning Top](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.132.253601)
- the acceleration of one nanosphere is around $10^{12}g$ and the stress between them is $2~\text{GPa}$.

6. Researchers at Nanosystems Initiative Munich rendered a microscopic DNA on a macroscopic lathe. It might look like AI generated, only the DNA is CGI.
- Physics article: [A Gentle Twist on DNA](https://physics.aps.org/articles/v14/98)

7. Deep convolutional networks took inspiration of cat visual cortex, deciphered by Hubel and Wiesel in 1962 "by tapping the signals from the nerve cells in the various cell layers of the brain cortex".
- Original paper: [Receptive fields, binocular interaction and functional architecture in the cat's visual cortex](https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1113/jphysiol.1962.sp006837)
- They won the [1981 Nobel prize in Physiology or Medicine](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1981/summary/)

8. Using a prism and the evanescent field to couple light from free space to on-chip photonic circuits (called thin-film light guides) at the time is as early as 1970.
- Paper from P. K. Tien and R. Ulrich: [Theory of Prismâ€“Film Coupler and Thin-Film Light Guides](https://opg.optica.org/josa/abstract.cfm?uri=josa-60-10-1325)

10. The Mpemba effect is the name given to the observation that a liquid (typically water) which is initially hot can freeze faster than the same liquid which begins cold, under otherwise similar conditions.
- Wikipedia: [Mpemba effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mpemba_effect)
- Original paper from E. B. Mpemba: [Cool?](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0031-9120/4/3/312)
