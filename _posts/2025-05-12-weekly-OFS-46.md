# OAM beams in laser printing

wow optical angular momentum beam is actually useful:
you could shoot stuff with laser for deposition or printing, and in the case of printing, an OAM beam or optical vortex (OV) beam could actually spin up the jet, make the printing better aligned and cause fewer splatters

(fancy name for this process is laser induced forward transfer (LIFT))
![20250506_015514_0.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20250505_20250512/20250506_015514_0.jpg)

# Visible-telecom photon pair source

nice visual for why quantum frequency conversion is important between different optical frequencies.
It's probably as important and much harder between microwave and optical frequencies 

(funny the frequency difference is 50 dB larger, and sota rates are also very roughly 50 dB worse)

# MoS2 optical voltage sensing

using 2D materials (MoS2) to sense E field from electrophysiological activity purely optically, because the fluorescence change by almost 1% from 1 mV. Pretty sick.

# Attosecond electron microscopy

from a bunch of fundamental constants you could find electrons in materials are vibing at 10s to 100s of attoseconds, how would one image their motion?

We can use the fastest thing we have control over (femtosecond laser, gives you 5 fs laser pulses) to generate an electron pulse (100s of fs) to probe the sample, as well as use the same thing to gate that pulse right before it reaches the sample, down to ~600 as or 6e-16 s.

The gating is done with an optical pulse that is mostly circularly polarized except for half a cycle of linear polarization, and this part couples with the electrons and filters/scatters them in time domain.
![20250509_155232_0.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20250505_20250512/20250509_155232_0.jpg)

   - I'm still confused how the polarization is changing along the gating pulse..
   ![20250509_161749_0.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20250505_20250512/20250509_161749_0.jpg)

   - there is some [controversy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14518) about it
   - all i could say is the polarization of the gating pulse is not really "linear for a half cycle" as they claimed

# Long-range optical interferometry

behold, imaging what someone is reading from almost 1 mile away, by pointing lasers at it and detect intensity interference of the reflection.

what's the catch? I don't understand the reconstruction yet, but they are taking about 600 pairs of points in fourier space each with 2 s integration time, so that is ~20 min per frame/image 

(and they are "cheating" by rotating the target)
