1. Starship super heavy's far field noise is 18 dB less than predicted at 35 km during launch, it's comparable to around 5 SLS launches and >= 10 Falcon 9 launches. The flyback booms are surprisingly only 50% louder than a Concorde boom.

2. Our energy consumption is only growing at a CAGR of 1~2%. I'd like to think this is one reason why we can't afford truely distributed manufacturing (yet) like smelting, casting, forging etc.
However, this is first-order not true: melting 40 lb steel only needs ~ 5 kWh.
![20241117_042835_0.jpg](/assets/images/2024/20241111_20241122/20241117_042835_0.jpg)

   - However, that's probably 2~10% of the total energy actually needed to do it properly. A naive comparison with FDM 3D printer: the energy spent on melting the plastic is roughly 1% of the total energy consumption.
Industrial steel processing should be more efficient.

3. Reading about optical phase change material GSST. Slow heat-cooldown turns it crystalline, and fast turns it amorphous, with very different refractive index.
Nice things are usually far from simple, they had to tune GST (existing PCM, already complex) to reduce its optical loss.

4. Saw another work using ULE.
They test hygroscopic swelling of adhesives using imaging interferometry and with some very good ULE specimen (30 nm flatness over 10 mm and parallelism of 20 urad). They could measure adhesive gap change of ~< 1 nm, and they tracked it for ~ 3 yr

6. Almost 10 years ago they showed below ambient T radiative cooling (reflect sunlight and radiate very well around 8~13 um, cooled by the cold outer space).
Few days ago, they made it directional. It no longer needs to directly face the sky, and can be used on vertical surfaces.

9. You might have seen Hero's engine before, shooting out steam to generate torque.
These people made one that's ~50 um diameter and using angular momentum of light (??), and it actually wins against viscous drag of water, spins at up to 300 rpm, and generates ~40 pN*um per mW

10. Side projects are the best

11. These folks want a really low ellipticity mirror (as axially symmetric as possible), and they spin a fused silica rod > 6000 rpm so that it revolves several times during the 10 ms pulse of CO2 laser machining. It came out so good that they can't really measure how good it is.
![20241120_023915_0.jpg](/assets/images/2024/20241111_20241122/20241120_023915_0.jpg)
   - They used both white-light interferometry and built a cavity to measure polarization dependent cavity resonance. Both results are dominated by measurement/reconstruction error.
Surface roughness is below 0.15 nm, also dominated by resolution limit of the AFM lol.

12. Optical fibers and integrated photonics have been around for decades to guide & manipulate ~1 eV or ~1 um light. I just learnt that waveguide for X-ray exists(~10 keV or ~0.1 nm light).
The WG is ~10 nm, its still single-mode so the output is coherent & can be used for holography

Check out this cute superconducting qubit at 72 GHz, and is >90% at ground state at 0.9 K fridge temperature.

And look at all these nice frequency extenders and harmonic mixers.

15. First time seeing something this big called a macriparticle, I guess it is technically not wrong. I'm gonna start calling my head an active macroparticle.
The idea: acoustic waves excite vibration of wings on a fan to rotate it, and could multiplex different DOF in frequencies.
