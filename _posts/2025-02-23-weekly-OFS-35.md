# Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays and the Telescope Array  

TIL the highest energy cosmic rays detected are on the order of 250 exa–electron volts, or ~40 J, enough to power an LED for 20 min...

They were detected by a humble experiment called the Telescope Array experiment, and the detectors are made of scattered "minecraft beds in the desert" (surface detectors), and densely packed fluorescence detectors with JWST-like segment spherical mirrors.

# Aluminum Blow-Off Foil for Q-Switched Lasers 
TIL an old technique to get sharp rise edge for a high power not-so-fast laser pulse: aluminum blow-off foil.
This was from the Q-switched laser era, and it could generate rise time < 5 ns. As the name suggests, it probably works by the laser beam blowing off the foil that was blocking the beam. Can't find much about it..

# Mach-Zehnder Interferometer Energy Conservation Paradox 
Optics/photonics folks, I have a series of very simple and basic quiz/nerd snipe for you:
When you look at the output power of a simple Mach-Zehnder interferometer with a delay in one arm, you see interference when you change wavelength.
1. What's up with energy conservation?
2. Now you make it on a chip with y-splitter or 1x2 MMI splitter, what happens to energy conservation?
3. If you place the detector directly at the location of the second beam splitter, what would it show when you change wavelength?
![20250216_213309_0.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20250216_20250222/20250216_213309_0.jpg)

   - About case 2: here is a MMI splitter 2D toy model, propagating from left to right, from right to left with the two ports in-phase, and out-of-phase. Most of the out-of-phase powers are radiated, some reflected. A y-splitter would look similar.
   - This is the danger many ignore about optics and photonics, there are always modes around you, nothing is really single-mode. (unless we have some magic broadband bandgap gel that fills up the rest of the space other than the waveguides..)

   - In 2, the energy is mostly scattered/radiated, so in a sense reflected from the output port
   - In 3, it depends on what kind of detector it is, e.g. if it is large area that captures all of both beams, it would sum up the spatial interference pattern and gives a flat power vs
   
   

# 3-Bit ALU & TinyTapeOut
I was so proud of my 3-bit ALU, and then found out it only took like 1/20 of the chip real estate..

# High-Q Piezoelectric Antenna for VLF Transmission 
A Tesla coil? Nope it is actually a piezoelectric antenna for VLF (3-30 kHz, or 10-100 km wavelength) without being huge, by using a mechanical resonance of a lithium niobate rod.

(well the voltage gets as high as 125 kV so it still looks like a Tesla coil discharging)

While it cannot cheat the antenna Chu-Harrington limit (yet?) so that the radiation Q is very high (~1e13), the mechanical Q~5e5 is much higher than what you would get with the electical version (Q~1000), so they claim it is relatively 300x more efficient. They also used direct antenna modulation (DAM) to cheat the Bode-Fano, and got 83x higher bandwidth (7 Hz vs 80 mHz).

The catch? The peak power dissipation is ~ 1 W before the crystal rod shatters, and only 2e-7 of this 1 W is radiated..

# Deep-Sea Shrimp and 12-Hour Biological Rhythms  
Deep-sea shrimps living near hydrothermal vents actually sync their biological rhythms to the 12 h tidal period instead of 24 h like us, likely from hydrostatic pressure.

And since we are from the sea, some of our genes and proteins having 12 h cycles might be related to this.

# Optical Convolutional Spectrometer for Compressed Sensing 

There are many ways to do spectroscopy, e.g. you can tune a narrowband source, or tune a narrowband detection, or add dispersion to map frequency to spatial domain, or tune a filter/mask in between a broadband source and simple detection.

This work is using a tunable filter/mask made with a "messy" transmission spectrum of four cascaded MZI with different delay, tuned with thermal phase shifters, and they called it convolutional spectrometer. Classification is done by a trained kNN model.

This really resembles some compressed sensing stuff, maybe time to re-read some of those.

# Miniature Surface-Tension-Based Swimming Robot
Centimeter-scale robots are the cutest ones. Too small it gets creepy, and too big it falls on you and breaks your bones.
This one is ~30 cm, it glides on water supported by surface tension, and moves around by flapping its fins to generate beautiful traveling waves at ~40 Hz, "inspired by marine flatworms like Pseudocerotidae".

It weights ~1 g (the locomotion module), could swim at 12 cm/s, carry ~5 g, and push things as heavy as ~100 g on water. The actuators are electrohydraulic, powered by a miniaturized high-voltage power supply that boosts a Li-ion battery voltage to ~600 V, and the 30 mAh little battery lasts 10 min.

# Visual Graphene Identification Using SiO₂ Substrates
This reminds me that graphene people use SiO2 film on Si wafer/chip with a certain thickness, so that even purely visually you could identify a region of single layer graphene on it from more layers, in the middle of the mess from mechanical exfoliation.

# Photonic Skin for Flexible Wearable Sensors 
Behold, the photonic skin!

Seriously, this is pretty sick. I've seen metal / dielectric metasurface on PDMS, but this is my first time seeing a PMMA-core photonic circuits on PDMS, and even infused with CLD–1 (an EO polymer) for tuning. The index contrast is only 1.49 vs 1.41, but they could already bend it by ~1 mm radius. Heck they even bonded LED and photodetector array onto it.

# Lithium Niobate Electro-Optic Modulator with BTO Cladding 
LOL, a lithium niobate electro-optic modulator with barium titanate cladding on quartz. (These three materials are all electro-optic)

This is like my gf putting three layers of sunscreens from three different brands.

(It's sim only. Also could've put the LN directly on quartz.)

# Atom Probe Tomography for Atomic-Scale Material Analysis
Wanna detect material composition down to ~1 ppm and ~1 nm spatial resolution? Check out atom probe tomography (APT), where you cut a tiny bit (~50 nm) of your sample, and put it on a probe tip inside ultra high vacuum (<1e-8 Pa), low temperature (~50 K), and strong E field (counter-electrode at 15 kV and a few mm away).

Now you shoot the sample with a ps or fs laser (or pulse the E field), ions shoot out of the sample, and you could use the usual mass spectrometry tricks to figure out what ions they are, as well as trace them back to where on the sample are they from, to get the spatial resolution.

# 3D-Printed Thermoelectric Materials with Enhanced Interfaces

(seems like at least since 2018)
