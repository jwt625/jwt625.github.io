# Neutrino detector with Cherenkov radiation

don't you just want one at home?

# Beamsplitter optomechanical cavity simulation

everything is beamsplitter, and beamsplitter is all you need

   - i got excited for a sec that they actually made the pointy optomechanical crystal cavity, but it's theory and simulation

   - one fun quote i'll steal from a prof is, you take a transparent material, and you poke air holes in it in the right way, and it became reflective. it's amazing

oof still a long way to go for VLM to process circuit diagrams.
Pretty much as good as random chance, and they are cheating by guessing according to the colors instead of tracing the wires.
