# Pockels laser with tunable DBR

Q: where would you do the first bond, on the chip or on the pin?

(laser with RSOA + LNOI electro-optic tunable DBR mirror)

   - i was at OFC and one ayar labs guy literally told me most of their power consumption is not the source, not the modulation, but the heaters tuning the microrings
   
   


# Ohio scanner and LIDAR beam steering

so many niche lores that rarely propagate beyond word of mouth, had no idea there is a name for this scanning approach called "Ohio scanner"

# 1.6T 2xFR4 transceivers from POET Technologies


almost thought the black chips are the laser chips, but they are likely the DSP/modulators. The four lil ones are, each with two lasers.
could also see one channel (the top one) on the AWGs are looped back likely for alignment

# Lithium niobate nanoimprinting with sol-gel

i'm impressed by "Lithium Niobate Nanoimprinting", sounds crazy first but it's sol-gel based. It's for imaging with SHG so you could directly see / detect 800 nm+ after the SHG.
![20250607_114303_0.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20250125_20250608/20250607_114303_0.jpg)
   - the efficiency probably really sucks, normalized intensity as usual, and the enhancement factor they claim in the abstract is comparing the focal point to the surface..

   - only if there is a way to orient the domains properly... nanoimprinting with a giant bias field maybe?
   ![20250607_155406_0.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20250125_20250608/20250607_155406_0.jpg)
   - but each nanostructure seems to be consistent enough to give you a polarization dependency of the SHG.. And the magnitude also really varies depending on how good a crystal it is (one of the curve is 10x, and "on-off ratio" over the whole angular range is also different)

# Silicon-aluminum interaction at high temps


you probably don't need to know this but silicon starts to form pits when in contact with aluminum and heat up to 400~450 C
![20250608_042958_0.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20250125_20250608/20250608_042958_0.jpg)
   - Chapter 1 (J.W. Mayer and S.S. Lau, Silicides - an intriduction) in Chen2004: [Silicide Technology for Integrated Circuits](https://google.com/books/edition/Silicide_Technology_for_Integrated_Circu/mR2bHUA7K8oC?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA1&printsec=frontcover)
   - that's a big dream!
   - i think the oxide window was on purpose
   - these look like shallow and random pits, idk probably could find some use for them
   - they pre saturate the Al with Si, or use different metals
   - Si is soluble in Al (0.5~1 at.%) and diffuses inside during the heat treatment

   - week 5 (43): no progress this week, continue wearing it.
   - week 4 (42): switched to a LiPo battery, it lasts several days!
   - week 3 (41): got a usb type-C power monitor. Sleep power too high, need debug
   - week 2 (40): Started wearing the camera at home & send thru wifi to desktop. Need to somehow save or send the photo to my phone when outside.
