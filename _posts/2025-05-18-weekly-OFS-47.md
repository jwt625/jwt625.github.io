# Deep tissue ultrasonic in vivo printing

deep tissue in vivo sound printing (DISP) from caltech 

(I only understand the ultrasonic aspects a bit. The cross linking agent is encapsulated & carried by low-temperature–sensitive liposomes (LTSLs). They did in vivo printing in mouse bladder and rabbit leg muscles)

# Multi-wavelength photonic quantum architectures

legend has it, every time you add one more wavelength onto your chip, a photonics design engineer's life expectancy on your team gets randomly reduced by one to three years

   - for multiple joints, if you have enough magnetometers at enough separations in real and angular space, it could still be invertible  would be hell to calibrate
