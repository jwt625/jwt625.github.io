You might have seen the \"[chandelier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilution_refrigerator)\" from IBM quantum, or Google quantum, as well as the shiny superconducting qubit chips. If you are curious what they are, and how you would do it yourself, you are at the right place! We'll go through most stuff that goes into it for measuring the superconducting (SC) qubits, how to design, make, and measure the qubit, and to begin with, how superconducting qubits got here.

Figure 1: examples of the dilfridge \"chandelier\" from [Google Quantum AI](https://quantumai.google/quantumcomputer) (you are seeing plates at different temperatures, and mostly microwave cables, attenuators, and filters), and packages used to house the superconducting qubit chips. Sometimes there is a PCB, sometimes it is just the bare chip directly wirebonded to connector pins. You can see SMP connectors used on the left, and SMA connectors on the right. They are the two most commonly used connectors.

Why do people want a quantum computer? It could help us [run simulations faster](https://arxiv.org/abs/1308.6253), such as the [chemistry ones](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature23879). It could help you [find your true love](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover%27s_algorithm) by dating 10 times with a superposition of 100 potential partners, instead of having 100 dates, or [crack the RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm) if that's what you are into more. In addition to computing, it could also help make better sensors, such as for [gravitational waves](https://www.nature.com/articles/nphoton.2013.177), [better telescopes](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.109.070503), and [dark matter](https://journals.aps.org/prxquantum/abstract/10.1103/PRXQuantum.3.030333) detection. I know, it's always the astronomers and cosmologists who have the coolest and craziest stuff, and many technologies used for SC qubits were originally developed by them as well! Because they share one thing: detecting very weak signals.

There have already been a lot of reviews on various aspects of superconducting qubits, why another one? I guess I'd love one that's easy to read, and fun to read. I've made and measured junctions, plumbed the dilfridge, and shot pulses into and out of it, but I'm in no way the expert in this field, so I'll try my best to point you to the experts. This will be a two-part series, and the first part is a chronicle of superconducting qubits.

# Part I: a chronicle of SC qubits

What is a superconducting qubit? It is a type of quantum bits (qubits), and it is superconducting. Quantum bits are similar to classical bits, with additional quantumness.
- What is quantum about a qubit is not the focus of this writeup, but some important aspects about it are: superposition, coherence, and entanglement.
- There is a more formal set of criteria for a working quantum computer called [DiVincenzo's criteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DiVincenzo%27s_criteria).

## Josephson junctions

There are many types of SC qubits, but they all share one component: [Josephson junctions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephson_effect) (JJs). JJs are old, maybe older than your parents, they are from the 1960s. And they sound simple: two superconductors with a thin insulator in between. For now, and for the most part of this article, remember one thing about a JJ: it is a weird nonlinear inductor. If you take a look at the equations that describe it, you'll see why it is weird and why it is nonlinear:

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; gap: 10px; justify-content: center;">

</div>
- Josephson equations

I apologize for including equations here, but I need one thing from it: the sine term. It means two things: it is a nonlinear equation, and there are going to be some periodic behaviors.

If you would like to know more about how and why JJs are weird like this, Feynman lecture III has an excellent [seminar](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/III_21.html) on them.

## Macroscopic quantumness

Fast forward about two decades, this [1985 paper](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.55.1908) from Michel Devoret and John Martinis at Berkeley, as well as Rob Schoelkopf's [thesis](https://www.proquest.com/docview/304166973) from 1995, are where we introduce the protagonists. Many years later, their descendents would be leading the charge at various industrial quantum labs. If you look up these two's work, you'll see keywords like \"mixers\", because that is one core application of JJs from their nonlinearity, \"noise\", which is a core aspect that motivates the evolution of qubit designs, and most importantly, \"macroscopic quantum tunneling\".
- \"Macroscopic\" is roughly referring to the collective state of the superconducting electrons in the superconductor, and they are behaving like \"quantum\", and with nonlinearity inherited from the JJ. Most quantum things are small, like a single atom, or a single photon, making them hard to handle.
- A macroscopic circuit behaving like a quantum could potentially make many people's life easier, and they measured some aspects of the quantum properties that were affected by shaking the circuit with some microwave.


## Nakamura, 1999

The definitive proof came [in 1999 by Nakamura](https://doi.org/10.1038/19718) ([arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9904003)), and here is how the circuit looked like:

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; gap: 10px;">
  <img src="/assets/images/imported/20250619-sc-qubits-intro/image1.png" alt="Image 1" style="width: 48%; max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
  <img src="/assets/images/imported/20250619-sc-qubits-intro/image9.png" alt="Image 9" style="width: 48%; max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

Figure 2: [Left](https://arxiv.org/PS_cache/cond-mat/ps/9904/9904003v1.Fig1.jpg): a single Cooper pair box, or a \"charge\" qubit. [Right](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14798): spoiler: the wires will get removed one by one (a transmon qubit in 2025).

It might look complicated, but it really just looks like any semiconductor circuit, you have some gates that are electrostatically controlling how charges move around, a reservoir, and an island they call a \"Cooper pair box (CPB)\", isolated by JJs on the left and right (because the superconducting electrons come and go in pairs, Cooper pairs). Using this arrangement, Nakamura showed the whole circuit is quantum (collectively, not just individual atoms being quantum), and he could control the state with a voltage pulse. The quantumness would die after about 2 nanoseconds, but he still dreamt about solid-state quantum circuits using it.


## Strong coupling and cQED

Many groups quickly caught up, including [Devoret](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1069372) ([arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0205343)) and [Schoelkopf](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature02851), the latter is a distinct breakthrough: wires are getting removed from the qubit, and fewer wires, less noise! (quite understandable for DC noise, right?)

![Image 11](/assets/images/imported/20250619-sc-qubits-intro/image11.png)

[Figure 3](https://schusterlab.stanford.edu/static/pdfs/Wallraff2004.pdf): a charge qubit (blue) coupled to a coplanar waveguide resonator (CPWR, the meander line)


In addition to less wires connected to the qubit, it also showed strong coupling between the qubit and a resonator. This does a few things:
- Because of the coupling, frequency of the qubit now depends on the resonator's state, and vice versa. This will be later used to manipulate and readout of the qubit state.
- The resonator also acts as a filter between the qubit and the external world, a crucial step towards reducing noise around the qubit frequencies.
- A [coplanar waveguide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coplanar_waveguide) is pretty much an unfolded coaxial cable, and you can cut two ends of it open to form a resonator with the microwave bouncing back and forth in between. It can be coupled capacitively shown in the red box. You will see many \"meanders\" from now on.


The qubit still dies after \~ 3 nanoseconds, but this has set a scheme for almost all future qubit manipulation and readout. Part of the reason why it dies fast is because the qubit is still sensitive to charge, that's why it's named charge qubit, and also why they need a [bias-tee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_tee) to control and use the center conductor of the CPWR as a gate electrode.


## Transmon

This charge noise is soon \"fixed\" by the [proposal](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.76.042319) and [realization](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.77.180502) of the most famous qubit type: transmon qubit.

![Image 5](/assets/images/imported/20250619-sc-qubits-intro/image5.png)

[Figure 4](https://painterlab.caltech.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/iqd_charge_insensitive_qubit_design_cooper_pair_box.pdf): Analogy and potential of a transmon qubit


Remember the sine term from the Josephson equations? It gives a cosine potential energy, and you could make the \"kinetic energy\" part of the circuit \"heavier\" with a larger capacitance, at the cost of reduced nonlinearity (bottom of the cosine looks like a quadratic potential well, which would give a linear restoration force instead of sine). Do it just right, you will have sufficient nonlinearity to get a qubit (nonlinearity larger than linewidth), while much less likely to tunnel through the peaks of the cosine. The charge noise is like a fluctuating background \"velocity\", and stays closer to the bottom of the potential, making it harder to tunnel. As a consequence, the qubit is less sensitive to charge noise.


Meanwhile, Martinis group has been focused on phase qubits, and did quite a few stunts (see [Lucero2012](https://web.physics.ucsb.edu/~martinisgroup/papers/Lucero2012.pdf) and [O'Connell2010](https://clelandlab.uchicago.edu/pdf/oconnell_nature.pdf)) with them. They finally decided transmon is the way to go, and made their own version called [Xmon](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.2322), and you'll see similarly X shaped capacitors in a lot of subsequent projects from them and Google.

Figure 5: an Xmon qubit from Martinis group, 2013. Julian Kelly's [thesis](https://web.physics.ucsb.edu/~martinisgroup/theses/Kelly2015.pdf), although mostly a compilation of papers just like most theses including mine, has a great lot of details on the qubit fabrication process, as well as measurement and calibration. Right: evolution of the Xmon geometriesfrom Kelly's thesis.

## Further improvements and scaling up

Once the transmon became the winner SC qubit, the efforts shifted to better qubit coherence time: better understanding of [material loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.5793), better ways to deposit aluminum or switch away from it (such as [tantalum](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-22030-5)), and cleaner ways to make the JJs (like [clever ebeam evap](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0037093) to avoid breaking vacuum, or [shadow mask](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5138953) to avoid resist residuals). In addition to making the single physical qubits better, more and more efforts are made towards scaling up the number of qubits, error corrections, and exotic qubit types.
- [Surface code](https://arxiv.org/abs/1208.0928) and [cat code](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04768) ([this cat](https://doi.org/10.1103/PRXQuantum.4.020350) lived more than 100 s) are two of the most adopted error correction codes. Roughly speaking, by embedding the computation to a subspace of a higher dimensional space (with more qubits or more states of a resonator), errors are detected as outside of the subspace, and can be projected back and corrected.
- There are a few directions for exotic qubits, some are for error correction / fault tolerance, such as the [0-pi qubit](https://doi.org/10.1103/PRXQuantum.2.010339), some are for [better packaging](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:c3311eef-7f31-4cfe-afd7-f3605b73ab36), and my favorite one is moving to higher frequencies like [these millimeter wave qubits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11170).

Figure 6: Left: 20 transmon qubit chip from [Rigetti](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05771), 2017. Right: [surface code qubit chip](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04612) from Andreas Wallraff group, 2024. It gets harder and harder to find the actual image of the chip when the number of qubits gets higher.


Lastly, I'd like to mention that there are many other aspects that evolved during the same period of time. People have added more filters, both on-chip and off-chip, amplifiers have gotten better, the resonators used for reading out the qubits are getting better, and the theory behind doing useful things with qubits is also getting easier to realize. This is an actively evolving field, no matter when or how it would eventually come to fruition, we'll get better understanding, as well as better and cheaper microwave and cryogenic technologies along the way!
