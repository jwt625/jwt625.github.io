# Monolithic Silicon Photonic ROADM

three years from the date of the SEMs taken, to the publish of the paper

( components from "a monolithically integrated silicon photonic chip of 192-channel reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexer (ROADM)" )
![20250901_193406_0.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20250711_20250908/20250901_193406_0.jpg)

# E. coli Engineered for Light Sensing

when you are so confident your paper is going to be a nature, feat. E. coli

# Coherence Memory in Mode-locked Oscillators

first time hearing about coherence amnesia..

( still deciding if this is actually interesting or on par with "optical barcode" )
![20250902_045828_0.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20250711_20250908/20250902_045828_0.jpg)

# Scalable Neutral Atom Qubit Array

imagine if every scientific paper models and renders the apparatus like apple and nvidia

(second pic generated by nano banana lol)
![20250902_151943_0.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20250711_20250908/20250902_151943_0.jpg)

   - still hard for the model to actually use reference images when there is a lot instead of its own shit.
   - This is a cool paper that makes neutral atom array more scalable.

# MicroLED Optical Interconnect with Microlens

microlens from microsoft

( for microLED based optical networking )

   - the LEDs radiate so wide they had to use custom microlens with TIR at the bottom half to reduce crosstalk.
   ![20250903_025107_0.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20250711_20250908/20250903_025107_0.jpg)

# SiN PIC with PZT for Atom Control

this paper included such a high res photo it deserves to have its own post

( silicon nitride PIC with PZT from pulsed laser deposition (PLD) for optical control of atoms )

# POET Optical Engine 3D Scan

big fan of keyence 3d scan, but this is a weird chip with weird stuff, maybe they are wirebonds? probe tips that are way out of focus?... there are also some long deep trenches, maybe for killing stray light.

( POET Blazar 1.6T optical engine )

   - You have a 3.3 V input rail but your system operates at 1.2 V.
   - What can you do?

Ongoing:
- Playground:
   - week 63:
      - Continuing [one click web paper](https://github.com/jwt625/PlayGround/tree/main/20250831_one_click_paper_page). Got actual deployment working. Had to refactor backend etc.
      - Also added traffic speed to [Bay Bridge traffic](https://bay-bridge-traffic.com). The repo was spun off from PlayGround last weekend iirc.

   - week 62: [one click web paper](https://github.com/jwt625/PlayGround/tree/main/20250831_one_click_paper_page)
      - ![One-click-paper](/assets/images/2025/20240926_20250811/one-click-paper.png)
      - took half a day to figure out a token scope problem...

      - ![BBT-dashbpard](/assets/images/2025/20240926_20250811/BBT-20250810.png)
      - https://bay-bridge-traffic.com
      - I think it is already getting hit hard and slowing down the detection, might have to take this down
      - nope not really getting hit hard, not sure what it was, added some rate limiting and restarted things, now back to 30 fps most of the time
   - week 58: Bay bridge traffic tracker
