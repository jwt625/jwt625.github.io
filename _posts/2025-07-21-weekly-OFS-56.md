# Open knowledge sharing in photonics

sharing this to remind both you and myself, put your work out there openly, put it on your own website so you control the process. Share knowledge in all forms, from making short-form videos that capture a few second in someone's attention span, to marble sculptures that last centuries. Knowledge only lives by being shared.

# Fiber optic gyro winding patterns

   - the winding patterns are to suppress sensitivity wrt. temperature gradient and distribution
      - I made a mistake in this post, these windings are not for canceling out the spatial distribution of temperature, but the time varying temperature gradient
      - with the simplest winding, the CW and CCW light will see different locations at different times, and a time varying temperature gradient has the same effect as rotation

# Stencil-based superconducting qubit fabrication

one of the craziest process I've seen, using a silicon membrane stencil to one-step ebeam evap a whole superconducting qubit chip including the junction.
no resist, no gunk!

# Chirped SAW IDT design

ohh what a beautiful chirped IDT
quiz: why is every electrode split into two?

( is surface acoustic wave twitter a thing? )
