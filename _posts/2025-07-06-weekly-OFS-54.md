# Far-field antenna pattern visualization

just realized why this style of plots always have been slightly and subtly pissing me off, it's because these are far field patterns, and they are drawn right onto the antennas..

# Lithography on diamond anvils

been seeing high pressure transport measurement every once in a while (high T high P superconductor etc), but never thought about how they wire it up.
Seems like people just do lithography on the diamond anvils as usual.
