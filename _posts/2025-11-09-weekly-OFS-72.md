# Subnanolitre wireless neural implant

this 0.3 mm x 0.1 mm chip from Cornell could actually go into your vaccine (it's sitting on a grain of salt). it's untethered & powered by photovoltaic, the same AlGaAs diode used for PV also acts as an LED and emits pulses that encode electrophysiological signals. ( the video is multiphoton microscopy imaging of the chip in a mouse brain )

# Continent-level image geo-localization

i thought general purpose LLMs are already quite good at geoguessing, specialized models are way better and blows gemini away for high accuracy. 200 m over a continent is creepy, that's ~1e-8 fractional area. the model is not just bruteforce image search/retrieval, because there would be too many images (>100 M), and they have to build a database of image embedding which combines a few existing methods. the ultimate guess is from a similarity argmax, i wonder if it could do better by e.g. weighting the coordinates of top three candidates.

# Fiber fuse effect micro-cavity fabrication

what people do to fibers to get fancy structures always exceeds my expectation. here is how you can get a bubble as a Fabry-Perot cavity *inside* a fiber with these four "simple" steps: 1. introduce periodic hollow damage centers in one fiber using catastrophic self-propelled self-focusing fuse effect 2. cleave it near the damage center, and splice with another good fiber, which blows up the damage into a drop shape cavity 3. cleave the spliced fiber again under microscope so that you could control where the cleaving is. The location affects the final cavity shape 4. splice it again with another good fiber and it will form a more symmetric looking cavity... the micro cavity size can be increased by shocking it again with the splicing arc..
![20251106_035441_0.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20251029_20251110/20251106_035441_0.jpg)
   - transmission sucks but hey look how fun it is Díaz2018: [A cost-effective edge-filter based FBG interrogator using catastrophic fuse effect micro-cavity interferometers]( https://doi.org/10.1016/j.measurement.2018.03.067)

   - this is really glass blowing but inside a fiber. you only need ~ 3 W to form these catastrophic fiber fuse effect periodic hollow voids, and they moves towards the optical signal source at ~ 0.5 m/s.

   - the effect itself is as old as from 1987, with very detailed description of the procedure. they tested it in as long as 1.5 km of SMF. Kashyap1988: [Observation of catastrophic self-propelled self-focusing in optical fibres]( https://doi.org/10.1049/el:19880032)

   <!-- - the pitch seems too big for it. Maybe if you play with the params and see if you could shrink it. also the index contrast is so strong there's going to be quite some scattering loss at the beginning and end of the array -->

# Millimicrosecond Kerr cell camera shutter

   - checking this because i saw an ultrafast camera shutter based on Kerr cell, and they called it millimicrosecond because nanosecond was not popular yet at the time.

- Playground:
   - week 72: 
      - Updated [3dgs viewer](https://github.com/jwt625/3dgs-viewer) to include 3rd order SH
      - setup and played with `kimi k2 thinking`, it barely runs on 8xH100.
      - Continued [DocEater](https://github.com/jwt625/DocEater)
         - started parsing all safe pdfs in my download folder. Actually as I type here (Sun Nov  9 23:28:59 PST 2025) it just finished the first pass:

<pre><code>================================================================================

</code></pre>
   - week 71: Continued [DocEater](https://github.com/jwt625/DocEater)
      - ran lint and type checks, tested all APIs.
   - week 65: Added more analysis to [bay bridge traffic](https://github.com/jwt625/bay-bridge-traffic-cam)
      - should really continue one-click-paper-page!
   - week 63:
      - Continuing [one click web paper](https://github.com/jwt625/PlayGround/tree/main/20250831_one_click_paper_page). Got actual deployment working. Had to refactor backend etc.
      - Also added traffic speed to [Bay Bridge traffic](https://bay-bridge-traffic.com). The repo was spun off from PlayGround last weekend iirc.
      ![BBT-speed](/assets/images/2025/BBT-speed.png)
   - week 62: [one click web paper](https://github.com/jwt625/PlayGround/tree/main/20250831_one_click_paper_page)

      - https://bay-bridge-traffic.com
      - I think it is already getting hit hard and slowing down the detection, might have to take this down
      - nope not really getting hit hard, not sure what it was, added some rate limiting and restarted things, now back to 30 fps most of the time
   - week 58: Bay bridge traffic tracker
