# Engineering ultrastable optical cavities for 1e-18 accuracy

people don't appreciate 1e-18 fractional accuracy enough. It took decades of development pushing many things to the extreme. For example, let's take a look at the optical cavity used for stabilizing the laser used for these atomic clocks. 

The most recent fight they had with the cavity is replacing the dielectric coating (sputtered SiO2/Ta2O5 or TiO2), which is amorphous, to stacks of crystalline GaAs/AlGaAs, because crystals have lower thermal mechanical noise than amorphous materials, and they got a cavity with 2.5e-17 stability with such quieter mirror coatings. [Lee2026] 

How good is 2.5e-17? When you are here, you are at the extreme opposite of "nothing ever happens". Everything is happening, and everything affects you. Temperature? It gives you at least two big headaches, (temperature fluctuation) * (thermal expansion), and thermal noise itself. 

So you optimize the cavity shape, you use single crystal for both the mirror spacer as well as the mirrors themselves so they are less lossy and thus less noisy, and you bond them together along the same crystal orientation as closely as possible. You also cooldown the cavity to reduce thermal noise, not only that, but you also operate at the CTE zero crossing point so temperature fluctuation matters less, thats why you see 124 K and 17 K for silicon cavities. 

Even with zero CTE, you still need few mK temperature control. Away from zero CTE, it may need to be stabilized to sub uK level. If you glance into cavities working at 4 K (i.e. small but not at zero CTE), you'll see crazy thermal damping systems to smooth out the temperature fluctuation of the 4 K cryostat (~20 mK), as well as find claims like "we now require only mK level control of the room temperature enclosure". [Zhang2017, Robinson2019] 

(they said "only" because some older cavities were at room T and controlled to sub mK [Ludlow2007], and they got tricks to reduce effects from room T.) 

(temperature gradient also gives you headache, which is why they choose silicon over glass, for its much higher thermal conductivity) 

Next is vibration/acceleration. Nothing is rigid, the cryostat vibrates, the earth rotates, and your cavity changes shape. Thats another motivation for silicon over glass, for its higher Young's modulus. So you make the cavity shape as symmetric as possible, and make the mounting fixture as symmetric as possible, and align them with the crystal axis because silicon's Youngs modulus not isotropic . Thus you also choose the optical axis to be the crystal axis with the highest Young's modulus. [Kessler2012] 

You also gotta align the mechanical axis with the optical axis and with the crystal axis, otherwise longitudinal acceleration would tilt the mirrors and change cavity length. The spacer shape is also a double cone so that it sags less and bends less under transverse acceleration. [Millo2009] 

Any mechanical resonance would be bad, so you also gotta use PEEK instead of PTFE for supporting the mounting ring, and push the lowest mechanical resonance to be as high freq as possible. Remember silicon's crystal structure? Remember its 3-fold rotational symmetry? That's why your support structure also has the same 3-fold symmetry. [Matei2016] 

If you have done all these properly, congratulations, now you might be ready to start fighting thermal noise in the dielectric mirror coatings.

# Rant on paper drafts with figures at the end

if you are putting out a paper draft, and you are having all the figures at the end of it just because it is more convenient for the journals to process it. I despise you. Do you not care about whether people would enjoy reading it? Do you even enjoy reading it yourself? Do you actually care about sharing your knowledge and experience? Or do you just care about getting it published? I hope I never have to work with you, I would never hire someone like you, and I would tell my friends coworkers random kids I met on the street dont be like you.
   - I'm going to use this thread to put example papers I have run into that does this.

# Nano-sculpted cavities for extreme mode volume reduction

sometimes I wish I could shrink these theory people and let them dig out their cavity design shovel by shovel. 

honestly I'd dig it too, only if we could shrink ourselves. this is pursuing smaller mode volume, which is about getting the resonant field of the mode to be as confined as possible, and then use it for sensing or coupling to an atom or emitter. But then you also have to put whatever stuff you want the cavity mode to couple to right at that spot..

   - week 82:
      - made a [parody website](https://github.com/jwt625/PlayGround/tree/main/20260117_realfab) mimicing the [realfood.gov](https://realfood.gov). Used claude code to mimic it as much as possible. Quite a lot of effort, took hakf a day to get the landing / on load animation and the problems section working. Gemini is pretty bad at describing animations. Did not finish and did not deploy it.
      - also made the hero video for this parody ralfab project, msotly with claude: [readfab announcement (parody)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_u3ubn5D0O8). Narrator voice from ElevenLabs.
      - made a [bad apple ver. with spatial light modulator (SLM)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWsCV2V8U-E) with Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm because claude can do it.
      ![bad-apple-slm](/assets/images/projects/bad_apple_SLM_frame_00444.png)
   - week 81: Reverse engineer Claude code with a proxy server.

   </div>
   - week 80: Made a few websites, including a [meme crystal one](https://quantacrystals.org/)
   <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; gap: 10px;">

   </div>
   and two on old RTS game sound effects, including [Red Alert 2](https://outside5sigma.com/ra2-sounds/) and [Warcraft 3](https://outside5sigma.com/WC3-sounds/).
      - the voice lines are transcribed and searchable!

Finished:
- Backyard landscaping (week 27-67). Should add this to timeline
   - Should also add the backyard shed to the timeline
