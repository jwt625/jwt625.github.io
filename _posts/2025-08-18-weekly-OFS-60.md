# Photonic interconnects with glass interposer

the nice thing about earth is it's already full of silicate, so if we melt and quench the whole thing, we would get a nice glass ball, and then we embed some fiber, and convert ourselves to photons, voila we'd be going around the whole thing in 0.2 s, and there would never be any traffic jam..

# Low-loss chip-to-chip couplers

i like this coupling approach, broadband and sub 1 dB IL.

Could have tilted the two waveguides wrt each other to make it even less sensitive to alignment

# Holographic MR display with VBG and SLM

crazy paper that combines high efficiency volume Bragg grating (VBG), spatial light modulator (SLM) for phase pattern, proper balance of coherence for light source, MEMS steering for color-angle multiplexing, and a neural waveguide model i don't understand yet, altogether to form a holographic MR display... won't be able to afford it for sure.
oh there is also a multilayer "apochromatic holographic eyepiece lens" that cancels the chromatic dispersion for the RGB color..

(from Stanford and Meta Reality Labs)
   - full vid from SI.

   - MEMS steering in sync with laser color, and the laser is picked to be partially coherent to reduce speckles/interference while still maintaining decent resolution for the holographic display

   - this holographic lens could be its own paper in some cases and it would be called ultra achromatic multilayer metasurface blah blah

   - they actually have power consumption analysis in the SI and it's not bad
   - (SLM and MEMS power consumption not in this, likely will also need more efficient drivers)

   - theres no way this many don't go wrong for 12 years, maybe thats why their standard for actual detecting something is so high


# Simulation vs physical prototyping (skin modeling)

simulations are nice and pretty much a no brainer, but there are also many cases where it might be cheaper and faster to just make and measure
![20250817_152525_0.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20250211_20250817/20250817_152525_0.jpg)

   - my guideline for most problems has been pen and paper should get you the right order of magnitude, simulations get to you ~10%, and iterate on the real world (and the sim) get you more and more 9s

   - week 59: "deployed" theBay Bridge traffic monitoring
      - inaccurate, unstable, and no guarantee on QoS, but anyway it is at bay-bridge-traffic dot com
      - ![BBT-dashbpard](/assets/images/2025/20240926_20250811/BBT-20250810.png)
      - https://bay-bridge-traffic.com
      - I think it is already getting hit hard and slowing down the detection, might have to take this down
      - nope not really getting hit hard, not sure what it was, added some rate limiting and restarted things, now back to 30 fps most of the time
   - week 58: Bay bridge traffic tracker
