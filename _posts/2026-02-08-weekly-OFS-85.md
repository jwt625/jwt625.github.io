   - i gotta learn from you guys
   - nope. It needs a driver for the Q-switching AOD, and also ~40 W diode pump lasers
   - +$69 (got it for $100)
   - yep the pump is ~ 50 W
   - 5 kg
   - i think so, thick af
   - this one has a very good beam, could focus to a very small spot and get higher res. Similar applications (marking, scribing, trimming etc) with higher precision you can also double this to 532 nm and get 3 W -->

# MEMS Gyroscope Electrode Array

look what i ran into today! a newer version but with a double shell, and for gyroscope instead of CSAC. 

the fabrication process is also wild, wafer cavity etch -> triple wafer bonding -> annealing/micro glassblowing -> back-lapping the substrate away -> bond again. 

this one has electrostatic actuation & readout, an even newer version has optical readout.

# Additive manufactured UHV chamber

what is this, what the heck is this, additive manufactured UHV chamber??? "the chamber can maintain pressures in the 1e−10 mbar range for over two hours without active pumping and that even after 48 h, the pressure remains in the 1e−9 mbar range" ..I guess it makes sense...

   - you know what, a lot of stuff can happen in 48 h
   - it still doesn't make sense to AM the whole chamber
   - they have a thin inner wall thats "fully sealed" LPBF, outer stuff just for structural support. All sealing surfaces machined post print. Guess the tests went well for this one.

# 3D Printed Anti-Splash Surface Analogy

most of our technology really hasn't moved that further away from your daily intuition, in the sense that if you've experienced the anti-splash urinal screen mats, you pretty much get how a broad range of broadband anti-reflection materials work, and even this 3D printed surface for better passive pumping. 

(well the Q-switched laser pulse being a toilet flush might be stretching it)

# Thin Film Thickness via Ellipsometry

let's try to guestimate the film thickness and uniformity here and see if grok actually guessed it right. As you'd expect, the perceived color looks amazingly similar across many single layer 
thin films. 

( left image made by claude and right image from [this tweet]( https://x.com/jwt0625/status/1994498739441209642) )
![20260202_173355_0.jpg](/assets/images/2026/20240131_20260208/20260202_173355_0.jpg)
![20260202_173355_1.jpg](/assets/images/2026/20240131_20260208/20260202_173355_1.jpg)

   - first is to figure out the stack. From the tweet as well as [this paper]( https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08820-7), we know it is MBE, and the thickness should be around 135 nm. 
   - there may be a STO buffer layer for the MBE [Mazet2015]( https://doi.org/10.1088/1468-6996/16/3/036005), but it would be thin (few 10s of nm), and close in refractive index, so we are gonna ignore it.
   ![20260204_061942_0.jpg](/assets/images/2026/20240131_20260208/20260204_061942_0.jpg)
   ![20260204_061942_1.jpg](/assets/images/2026/20240131_20260208/20260204_061942_1.jpg)
   - next is to get the reflection response of the stack, which is pretty simple from transfer matrix method. You can ask claude to do it in 2 min. The reflection depends on angle and polarization, and measuring the change in polarization components' relative amplitude and phase is actually a very robust measurement for film thickness and/or refractive index. One company making such equipment is J.A. Woollam, and they have a nice series of tutorials on how it works (and even a book iirc) 
   - [J.A. Woollam - Ellipsometry Tutorial]( https://www.jawoollam.com/resources/ellipsometry-tutorial)
      - I've spent countless sessions on such tool measuring TFLN thickness taht I could probably yap for a while on its calibration, fit recipes, optimizing the incident angles, optical anisotropy and Euler angles of your model etc. Also the software/GUI sucks.
   ![20260204_062608_0.jpg](/assets/images/2026/20240131_20260208/20260204_062608_0.jpg)
   - here are the results from claude, it picked Sellmeier equation to model the wavelength dependency of BTO's refractive index even without explicit ask (good bot), and I asked it to calculate both the ellipsometry results (left, should look very familiar to you if you've done it), as well as the reflection spectrum (right). The ellipsometry angles are chosen to be around the brewster angles because you'll see it blow up and be sensitive to film thickness. The reflectance is calculated near the actual angle where the photo was taken from the aspect ratio of the wafer.

   ![20260204_064759_1.jpg](/assets/images/2026/20240131_20260208/20260204_064759_1.jpg)
   - next, we need some assumptions on the light source and the camera. I have no idea on them so claude made the call of using D65 Standard Illuminant and sRGB and CIE 1931 2° Standard Observer. I have no idea what these means. But anyway now you get color vs thickness vs angle.

   - correction: it's more like 53.5 deg. it's also tricky to get rid of the glare..

   - guess you really need a good model for the source and the glare to make these results more trustworthy.

# Quasi-Zero Stiffness Vibration Isolator

hmm cool quasi zero stiffness device by combining a v-shaped bistable beam (VBB) and a diamond-shape mechanism (DSM), so the force displacement curve slope adds up to near zero. 3d printable too.

# Few-Photon Two-Photon Absorption Lithography

i have to constantly update my perception on what is possible with TPP/TPA. Nonlinearity is weird, and you have both optical and chemical nonlinearity, and amazing things happen when your pulse gets shorter and shorter. This is with a green fs laser at 517 nm.
![20251227_204558_0.jpg](/assets/images/2026/20240131_20260208/20251227_204558_0.jpg)

   - they call it few-photon irradiated TPA (fpTPA), where a single pulse only has 1000~2000 photons. still not intuitive to me why the radial density of possible TPA events drop this fast from monte carlo.. it gets more stochastic as the pulse gets weaker, so you could use multiple pulses / exposures to improve the contrast.

   <!-- - hmm good point, these are all classical "boring" photons. Maybe you'll get a sqrt(N) boost like SQL, then not worth it if it's a two photon process -->
   <!-- - true, OPA/OPO underrated -->

   - week 82:
      - made a [parody website](https://github.com/jwt625/PlayGround/tree/main/20260117_realfab) mimicing the [realfood.gov](https://realfood.gov). Used claude code to mimic it as much as possible. Quite a lot of effort, took hakf a day to get the landing / on load animation and the problems section working. Gemini is pretty bad at describing animations. Did not finish and did not deploy it.
      - also made the hero video for this parody ralfab project, msotly with claude: [readfab announcement (parody)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_u3ubn5D0O8). Narrator voice from ElevenLabs.
      - made a [bad apple ver. with spatial light modulator (SLM)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWsCV2V8U-E) with Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm because claude can do it.
      ![bad-apple-slm](/assets/images/projects/bad_apple_SLM_frame_00444.png)
