# AlOx-Based EDWA
An Erbium-Doped Waveguide Amplifiers (EDWA) that you can pre order, from Aluvia Photonics, with AlOx instead of nitride, offering "high external fiber-to-fiber gain (>25 dB) and low noise figure (comparable to EDFA’s)"

# Nanopillar Antireflection via Tape Residuals
You could make these nanopillars by etching tape residuals, and it's even better than doing it intentionally with "self-assembled monolayer silica colloidal crystals as templates"  beautiful
- (Fig. 1a has a wafer half clean and half with the colloidal crystals, and after the etch in Fig. 1b, the half without the crystals is darker/better. And the bottom two wafers are just with the tape on top, rinsed with IPA a bit so shit under the tape spreads out on the wafer, and then etched.)

# Josephson Junction Energy-Speed Performance
Is this claim accurate?
- “Josephson junctions have the highest speed over energy quotient of any active circuit element, so there is no known method to computer faster with less energy.”

# BaTiO3 Microwave-Optical Transducer Airbridges
These are some of the fluffiest puffiest airbridges, can I poke one 
![20250119_200127_0.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20241101_20250124/20250119_200127_0.jpg)

   - These airbridges are basically "copper interconnects" but for superconducting circuits, because dielectrics are lossy and you want as little of them involved as possible. They have been around for a while, if you are interested this is a good read (and there are many others).

   - The image above is a new one based on MEMS, they split a wide waveguide to either transmit or TIR the input beam, with a sawtooth edge to taper the light to have more tolerance for gap size & prevent stitching

   - PsiQuantum's switch chip is also 64x64 (128x128 next), and seems to have a similar topology. But it is electro-optic so much faster and probably lower IL, but would be more annoying to calibrate (?)
   ![20250120_083407_0.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20241101_20250124/20250120_083407_0.jpg)
   - Vertically actuated adiabatic coupler, mesh topology. Electrostatic pull-in lets them to contorl the n*n array with just 2n signals. Their 64x64 chip has the best pictures, but they have made 128x128 ones and 240x240 ones that are beyond one reticle size.

   - Google's OCS is not exactly on-chip but the MEMS mirrors are on-chip. 176x176 max and they use 136x136. Very broadband and low IL.

   - Ok I found those old MEMS mirror (this is derailing from on-chip but they are so sexy I have to). 5 dB IL and 38 dB crosstalk. No degradation after 18 billion cycles.

# 1770km Subsea OFDR Seismic Sensing
Optical frequency domain reflectometry (OFDR) for distributed acoustic sensing has been around for a long time and used in many places, usually 10~100 km range.
This is the first time it's done in a 1770 km long subsea cable, and they could detect different seismic waves arriving along different trajectories.

# Cryogenic Heat Capacity
Fun fact, heat capacity of most materials goes as T^(1~3), so it's much easier to heat things up (unintentionally) at low temperatures.
Every time you switch those blue shiny Radiall microwave switches, it could heat up stuff at the 10 mK MXC plate more than 10x, and >30 min wait to cool back down.

# LCoS-Based Wavelength-Selective Switch
Ultrawideband wavelength-selective switch.
Different input of the fiber array is separated vertically and spread out horizontally onto the grating, and then separated horizontally by wavelengths onto the liquid crystal on silicon (LCoS). The LCoS could then add a linear phase with a "sawtooth hologram" to steer different wavelengths separately.

   - Pitch can be as small as 50 um, so it's actually pretty handy.
   - The other end might be people size lol if they are the usual connectors

# Long ultra-High-Q Silicon Nitride Resonators
When your waveguide is so dense and so long your chip actually looks like a tiny CD.
(6 um x 80 nm silicon nitride with oxide cladding, 10 m total length, and intrinsic Q = 340 million..)

# CNN-Guided Robotic Fiber Connection System
Mobile robot with a Kinova Gen3 arm to change fiber connections. 
Object detection is YOLOv7 fine tuned with 40 images (expanded to 200 with cutout, add noise, and change saturation & brightness), resulting average precision ~ 0.96.

The fiber insertion requires 0.4 mm margin, while the arm repeatability is 1 mm, so they trained a CNN to generate actions from two camera images. Success rate 100% with 100 trials and average insertion time ~ 18 s.
