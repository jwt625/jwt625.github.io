# Multiscale quantum token feasibility chart

are they trying to say quantum physicists are on mushrooms

# Ultra-high dynamic range fiber Bragg grating filter

What's the highest dynamic range signal you've ever encountered / measured? (this is a very nice fiber bragg grating (FBG) )
![20241208_014444_0.jpg](/assets/images/2026/20241208_20260223/20241208_014444_0.jpg)
   - Screenshot from Field2024: [Efficient, ultra-high attenuation fiber Bragg grating filter for photon noise suppression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00981) 
   - They did heterodyne and got the dynamic range from a spectrum analyser.
   ![20241208_014858_0.jpg](/assets/images/2026/20241208_20260223/20241208_014858_0.jpg)
   - Typical high dynamic range power meters (like Newport 2103) and avalanche photodetectors (APDs) could give you 60~70 dB. Funny typical SNSPD also gives you a similar number (10~100 Mcps max).
   - If you have a good tunable attenuator, that would give you another 40~60 dB. Pulling the fiber just a bit outward of the connector is a pretty effective attenuator lol (as long as you measure it), did it a few times trying to get a ~90 dB dynamic range measurement.
   <!-- - Yeah this is pretty crazy. It's motivated by some quantum stuff, people are trying to do single photon detection of a very weak sideband while there is a strong pump nearby (~70 dB ish higher and a few GHz away) -->
   <!-- - so... what's the Q? -->

# Human body communication channel measurement

ever wondered what's the S21 between you and your partner? now you know it is about -100 dB. honestly explains a lot. (at 10 MHz, between wrists)

# AI-assisted research paper extraction

im now a huge fan of codex, it's damn good at pulling stuff from arxiv, open access journals, fcc filings..

# Space-based solar and compute infrastructure

if all fossil fuels on earth shall be burnt sooner or later (which i quote from a friend will happen because they generate value), spending them on launching solar panels and compute into space is the best we can and should do.
   - yes they'll still get burnt tho
   - like this from [xAI]( https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/10/technology/elon-musk-lunar-factory.html) as well as google's [suncatcher]( https://research.google/blog/exploring-a-space-based-scalable-ai-infrastructure-system-design/)

# Stagnation in residential energy consumption

this is sad, why did the residential stop going up? why did everything stop going up? I want a 10 kW laser at home that is constantly running, I want a LPBF running at 5 kg/h throughput. What happened in the 2000s that stopped all curves from going up?

# Optical fiber demand from drone guidance

me: hey gemini, how much optical fiber manufacturing output did fiber-optic guided drones consume in 2025? 

gemini: blah blah it represents a vanishingly small fraction of total global manufacturing capacity—likely less than 0.1% by volume 

me: thats bs I heard it was 10%. How plausible is this number? 

gemini: In 2026, the claim that drones consume 10% of global optical fiber manufacturing capacity is no longer just a rumor—it has become a focal point of industry tension.

# Fire as a foundational energy technology vs Datacenter Cancellation

makes me think of how the first Homo erectus who tried using fire might have looked and felt like at the time, and then i realized there's merely any social structure at the time, was there any idea of doctrine, and idea of disruptive innovation? Were fellow Homo ererctus afraid of it? or the survival benefits were so obvious and immediate and it's respected and adopted asap? to be honest the way we power society and these datacenters hasn't changed much, power is mostly from scaled up larger and hotter fires.

imo the fire will continue to burn, adopting fire makes you much more likely to survive in society and on this planet no matter when or where, and there are better ways to burn stuff, and use the fire on better things

# Directional muon communication using laser plasma

very nice demo, if it's not directional enough, would still be jammable. 

to really be safe, you either make it highly directional, or use some very uncommon waves or particles. 

now hear me out, laser plasma muon source: highly directional, exotic particles, penetrate thick rocks, and muon detection is cheap.

# AI inference cost and electricity export

wondering how much of these curves are going to be reflected in inference token prices. There is no traditional tariff or customs for digital service exports, and all the infra and electricity there are going to be more and more indirectly exported. We need more power generation. AI stuff aside, how are you going to run reindustrialization without electricity? also the culture problem is so deep like this autocorrelation.

# Self-charging photovoltaic battery fibers

TIL people make photovoltaic and battery embedded fibers, so you can make self charging power textiles, ~100 mW under indoor illumination, and a tiny 7 mAh battery, enough to power some wearable sensors. 

you can even wash it a few dozens of times and capacity only drops about 10%, good news for people who don't like washing their clothes often lol

   - week 82:
      - made a [parody website](https://github.com/jwt625/PlayGround/tree/main/20260117_realfab) mimicing the [realfood.gov](https://realfood.gov). Used claude code to mimic it as much as possible. Quite a lot of effort, took hakf a day to get the landing / on load animation and the problems section working. Gemini is pretty bad at describing animations. Did not finish and did not deploy it.
      - also made the hero video for this parody ralfab project, msotly with claude: [readfab announcement (parody)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_u3ubn5D0O8). Narrator voice from ElevenLabs.
      - made a [bad apple ver. with spatial light modulator (SLM)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWsCV2V8U-E) with Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm because claude can do it.
