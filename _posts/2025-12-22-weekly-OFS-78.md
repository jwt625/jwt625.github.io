# Magnetorheological finishing for large optics

I did not dig into what is the exact polishing method at the time, and it is pretty mind blowing: it's called magnetorheological finishing, and it is used for big optics a lot more. It reduces damages because the particles in the slurry are aligned with a magnetic field, and the "fluid's shape and stiffness can be magnetically manipulated and controlled in real time." People make amazing aspheres and large aperture optics (>400 m) with it.

# Sub-micron rabbit cutout memory search

i remember looking for this sub micron rabbit cutout a while ago for so long i started doubting my memory, semantic image search also did not help at all. human beings have this amazing ability of keeping many background processes running at the same time for almost indefinite duration, that when i ran into it randomly today i could immediately pull out this open case and mark it as closed. or many this is just one of the few outside five sigma cases that i could remember..

# Metalens arrays for parallel 3D nanolithography

this work as well as the one in the quoted tweet are really some of the best fits for metasurfaces. you can't really win with metasurface over size of your optical system (weight yes, but you can't get rid of space needed to fit the number of modes you need to deal with), nor over power handling (?). The best you can take advantage of is the extra flexibility and degrees of freedom. Once you start seeing this, it becomes natural to pair it with SLMs, and you end up with a massively parallel and reconfigurable array of beams. this configuration also has more relaxed requirements on alignment, writefield stitching etc during the fab process, it's so nice, probably also much easier to mass produce with nanoimprint.
