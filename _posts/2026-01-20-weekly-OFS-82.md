# SPDC-based MIR spectroscopy without MIR photons

hmm interesting MIR spectroscopy approach directly using the species to be sensed in a SPDC process, so that you do not need a MIR source, nor a MIR detector. the spectroscopy signal is the NIR photon rate variation which is affected by the MIR absorption because the SPDC photons are correlated. (source is 780 nm and detection is 1 um)

# Thermomechanical nanomolding of nanowires using AAO

TIL thermal molding works all the way down to tens of nanometers. since the scale is so small you can play with the elemental distributions by controlling their relative diffusivities with different molding temperatures.

# Re-imaging phased array as a high-speed SLM

interesting phased array created by bouncing a beam acound a few mirrors, a Re-Imaging Phased Array as they call it, or a "free-space arrayed waveguide grating (AWG)" if you are photonics brained like me. With a catchy name "a 10 Megahertz Spatial Light Modulator". this is also the conjugate version of optical arbitrary waveform generator (AWG), which is popularly implemented with grating + SLM + grating, mapping spatial domain modulation back to frequency domain. So technically you could make an optical AWG with the above fast SLM that is based on a "free space AWG" lol. (there is no point in doing this you'll just be back to using the EOM for shaping the beam, or will you?) also what is stopping you from having one AWG chip for the 1st RIPA, and then stack another few dozens of AWG chips for the 2nd RIPA? (it's the "poor" bw of the EOM = long delay needed to separate different freq components into separate spatial channels)

   - total control bandwidth is higher than SLMs if the EOM is very high bw, tho SLM could handle more spatial modes per pixel. I need to think about this a bit more..

# Synchronized elevator arrival as a coincidence event

there were two elevators that arrived on the same floor i was on this morning, one going up and stopping here, the other one going down and stopping here as well. the arrival times were so in sync, that the sound effects perfectly overlapped in duration and made the pitch variation in time perfectly symmetrized, although one of them goes up in pitch and the other one goes down as they are designed to match the moving direction of the elevator. Even the indicators on the wall were blinking in perfect sync, one in red and one in green. 

i didnt have time to record any of this, i didnt even realize what i just experienced until i was already in one of them. 

idk what else to say i just felt like this is such a rare event without any coordination that i have to write something about it. it's like getting a coincidence count in a heralded entanglement swapping experiment without compensating for a random delay, and it also reminds me that if you want to release and later catch a pulse with a qubit perfectly, you gotta tune its coupling rate in time to symmetrize the pulse shape in time as well.

# Chinese room argument and simulated understanding

i do not get a lot of these thought experiments at all. what is the difference between understanding and simulating the understanding? what do they even mean? why do you think there is anything special about thinking, about understanding, about intentionality, about consciousness at all? 

i used to feel weird about myself being able to ride and control a bike at all in the context of classical mechanics, in the sense that everything is predictable with a given lagrangian. And then you start appreciating dissipations, nonlinearities, and chaos more. You could always add more layers to explain and unexplain more things simultaneously. You'll keep adding more kinds of energies to keep or break the old but new theorems. 

same for learning or understanding, aren't you always starting with simulating the understanding, and you do it frequent and long enough it becomes natural enough so that you feel comfortable calling it understood? If you keep operating this English version of the program and it slowly becomes your muscle memory, I say you understand Chinese now. You work in the Chinese room and you'll understand Chinese. (and then I got into a fight with GPT5.2 on whether pure gravity-based consciousness is possible or not)

# E. coli chemosensing below Berg-Purcell limit

it's been almost 50 years since the Berg-Purcell limit on how well you can sense your environment, and now people just showed that these E. Coli are actually two orders of magnitude dumber than the limit. why are you waiting to learn and analyze your environment perfectly? just go fuck around & find out. 

( be wary this only applies if you feel like you are in the low Re, weak gradient Purcell swimmer regime ) 

( figure shows the sensing efficiency as fraction of the limit vs background concentration for different gradient strength )

# Sol-gel TiO2 metasurface fabrication via NIL

i could feel my preference of fab process to be industry standard and that i am familiar with. There is always a tendency of overvaluing your existing skills and knowledge than adapting and learning the new ones, and it is dangerous. You have to constantly update your assumptions and preferences. 

these metasurfaces are made of TiO2 sol-gel using some water hydrolysis and polycondensation process that looks like magic to me, and then spin coat, stamped and crystalized after 600C calcination. Scale bar 1 um, looks pretty good, nice aspect ratio too.

Ongoing:
- MOOSE:
   - week 79: got peacock working
- GDSJam:
   - week 76 & 77: Many PRs. Got editor working.
   - week 75: many [commits and PRs](https://github.com/jwt625/gdsjam). Also tried vide coding a chip using claude and GDSFactory ([tweet](https://x.com/jwt0625/status/1995332640539615721)). Added examples on front page:
   ![gdsjam-examples](/assets/images/projects/gdsjam-examples.png)
   - week 74: got MVP of a MVP working, can do full client side rendering, and basic file sync. Made a [tweet](https://x.com/jwt0625/status/1992508531078263058) about it.
   - Week 73: bought a domain [GDSJam.com](https://gdsjam.com)
- Playground:
   - week 82: 
      - made a [parody website](https://github.com/jwt625/PlayGround/tree/main/20260117_realfab) mimicing the [realfood.gov](https://realfood.gov). Used claude code to mimic it as much as possible. Quite a lot of effort, took hakf a day to get the landing / on load animation and the problems section working. Gemini is pretty bad at describing animations. Did not finish and did not deploy it.
      - also made the hero video for this parody ralfab project, msotly with claude: [readfab announcement (parody)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_u3ubn5D0O8). Narrator voice from ElevenLabs.
      - made a [bad apple ver. with spatial light modulator (SLM)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWsCV2V8U-E) with Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm because claude can do it.
      ![bad-apple-slm](/assets/images/projects/bad_apple_SLM_frame_00444.png)
   - week 81: Reverse engineer Claude code with a proxy server.

   and two on old RTS game sound effects, including [Red Alert 2](https://outside5sigma.com/ra2-sounds/) and [Warcraft 3](https://outside5sigma.com/WC3-sounds/).
      - the voice lines are transcribed and searchable!

   - week 72: 
      - Updated [3dgs viewer](https://github.com/jwt625/3dgs-viewer) to include 3rd order SH

      - https://bay-bridge-traffic.com
      - I think it is already getting hit hard and slowing down the detection, might have to take this down
      - nope not really getting hit hard, not sure what it was, added some rate limiting and restarted things, now back to 30 fps most of the time
   - week 58: Bay bridge traffic tracker

- SC qubit basics for the zine. DDL THIS WEEK (week 60)!
- (week 53): mic and system audio transcriber: [ChatGPT Voice Mode Transcript Recorder](https://github.com/jwt625/VoiceModeTranscript)
   - the original goal was to get 4o to interview me and extract the decaying old knowledge in my head as much as possible, but now im also transcribing all audios that's going into/thru my head at least from my computer. One of the many steps towards a context knowledge base.
