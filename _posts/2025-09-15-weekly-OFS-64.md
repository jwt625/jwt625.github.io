# Filter design with arrayed waveguide gratings

why do you need more modes to have a better filter?
do you?

   - in this context, modes are refering to the eigenmodes inside a finite space of a wave problem, mostly em waves or acoustic/mechanical waves. Whatever wave it is, it's a linear problem, and you'll have eigen vectors and eigen values. And when the space is finite, the eigen values are discrete.
   - Here are more examples, each line or hairpin supports many modes, and usually only the fundamental one is used in the freq band of interest. Similarly, one optical mode from one ring, and one mechanical mode from each FBAR.
   - In all these cases, more modes are used to get a better filter.
   - So what is a better filter?

   - There are still more to talk about modes, like internal loss and coupling to external world (input-output theory & fluctuation-dissipation theorem), potential nonlinearities etc. Let's take a look at what is a good filter.
   - A filter does one thing: it lets some frequencies thru (passband), and rejects other frequencies (stopband). Naturally you get the metrics: how well it pass thru aka insertion loss (IL), how well it stops aka attenuation, and how sharp the transition between the pass and stopband is aka selectivity.
   - there are various other ones such as size, weight and power handling etc.
   - The selectivity is probably the easiest to understand because of the duality of time and frequency: if the device is capable of distinguish two very closely separated frequencies, the wave needs to spend more time in the device.
   - This is why in the AWG example, they needed 9 cm length difference to get 1 ns delay to resolve 1 GHz channels. Similarly, this MZI has a large length diff., plus a large ring resonator coupled to it, to achieve a very sharpe frequency response for laser locking.

# FDTD simulation and GPU acceleration

i'd like to think that flexcompute forced them to put lumerical FDTD onto EC2.
would they support GPUs if we trash talk them more?

   - i have no idea that ansys lumerical FDTD actually [supports GPUs since ~ 2023](https://optics.ansys.com/hc/en-us/articles/17518942465811-Getting-started-with-running-FDTD-on-GPU)

Planning:
- Writing:
   - cleanroom misc
- Wave demo with ~ 300 Hz water surface wave + 3D printed components
- One-click web paper publishing: every time i see a pay walled paper i get pissed off. I should build something to help people publish their paper as their own website.


Ongoing:
- Playground:
   - week 63:
      - Continuing [one click web paper](https://github.com/jwt625/PlayGround/tree/main/20250831_one_click_paper_page). Got actual deployment working. Had to refactor backend etc.
      - Also added traffic speed to [Bay Bridge traffic](https://bay-bridge-traffic.com). The repo was spun off from PlayGround last weekend iirc.
      ![BBT-speed](/assets/images/2025/BBT-speed.png)
   - week 62: [one click web paper](https://github.com/jwt625/PlayGround/tree/main/20250831_one_click_paper_page)

      - ![BBT-dashbpard](/assets/images/2025/20240926_20250811/BBT-20250810.png)
      - https://bay-bridge-traffic.com
      - I think it is already getting hit hard and slowing down the detection, might have to take this down
      - nope not really getting hit hard, not sure what it was, added some rate limiting and restarted things, now back to 30 fps most of the time
   - week 58: Bay bridge traffic tracker
      - [tweet](https://x.com/jwt0625/status/1952093334476095643)
