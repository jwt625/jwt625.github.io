# Square-core fiber Talbot effect

first time seeing a square-core fiber (SCF), and you get nice patterns from Talbot effect

sorbent-based atmospheric water harvesting (SAWH)

(its productivity varies vs. humidity and temperature etc, but a good order-of-magnitude number to remember is ~ 1 L/m^2/day, feels pretty high)

# RSA factoring with noisy qubits

"factoring a 2048 bit RSA integer requires less than a million noisy qubits and will finish in less than a week"

they probably still need quantum interconnects between many dilfridges 

(there is some chance to fit 1 M qubits inside a single dilfridge..)

# Cheese flower morphogenesis

good morning, we now understand the shape of cheese flowers better

it's a combination of radial distribution of Youngs modulus and yield stress of the cheese, inhomogeneous & irreversible metric change (it got stretched differently, e.g. more plastic towards the core), and inhomogeneous plastic shrinking because of the radial variation of friction between the cheese and the blade. They learnt a lot from the metal cutting community.

(maybe I should start collecting a culinary series)
