( originally written on 2019-03-19, converted on 2025-10-12. )

The approach:
- see the leakage mode from PNC defect into mirror
- see the response of NB mirror in the single mode region
# 20190319, first trial

PNC only:

## PNC 2 WG
file: model54_PNC2WG_LNX_20190319_solved_2.5GHz.mph
Freq changed a lot, increased by  400 MHz

Too close to the mirror cell bandgap edge, going to try lower freq.
After pushing down the mode to 2.27 GHz, much more confined, but mirror cell motion very similar.
Correspond to Gamma point mode of the mirror:

The mode really leaks into the closest available mode of the mirror:
- converted from mostly in-plane to mostly out-of-plane

# 20190320, shaking the NB mirror cell
Use prescribed disp + freq domain to see the leakage mode into the NB mirror cells.

Path: `COMSOL/LN/UnitCell1DCavity/FBH/20190319_DrivenMirror`

Usually got this error:

![Image 20](/assets/images/imported/lnx-pnc-to-wg-20190319/image20.png)

- the relative error is usually lower than in the screenshot, \~ 0.05
Changed PML:

Shake it up and down according to the above PNC2WG sim:
- at 1.8 GHz

## side coupled
rel. error 0.04

Conclusion:
- there are evanescent wave of other modes
- dominated by the Long1 if there are enough
# 20190320, param sweep of NB mirror to make it better single moded
Path: `COMSOL/LN/UnitCell1DCavity/FBH/20190320_paramSweepForSingleModeL1`

Idea: the NB mirror is already single moded for Long1 in \~ 1.6 GHz to 2 GHz
Trying to make this single mode region larger.

Sweep around default by +-10%
Solving just Gamma and X point.

- for X point, green and light blue is the single-mode region edge
i.e., larger amp and smaller hy

Hmm, looks like almost the best.
