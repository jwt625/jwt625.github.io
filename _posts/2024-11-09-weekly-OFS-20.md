1. The superconducting qubit, spin qubit, quantum dot qubit, and atom/ion qubit (list not exhaustive) people gotta catch up with their quantum starter kit

3. Usually you'd be shaking the tip for scanning force microscopy, but I guess you could also shake the sample:
They put their samples on a thin nitride membrane, and use lasers to shake and probe the membrane's amplitude & frequency, which are very sensitive to the scanning tip.

4. Folks, we are approaching Mpps (mega pairs per second) for entangled photon pair distribution, and it's running in New York's city fibers (GothamQ... better than the BARQNET(Boston-Area Quantum Network)). The fidelity drops for higher rate, and lots of pains from polarization.

5. Delft and The Hague, Netherlands joined the game after New York and Boston. They entangled nitrogen-vacancy centers separated by 10 km. All degrees of freedom (phase, polarization etc.) of the two light paths need to be stabilized. They got ~ 60% fidelity at 0.5 Hz rate.

   - The success rate per attempt is ~ 1e-5, so seems like they could repeat their protocol at almost 100 kHz (their clock rate is 100 kHz). The 0.5 Hz is postselected. For fully heralded entanglement that can be actually used, the rate is ~ 20x slower bc of extra communication delay.

10. You might have seen the tetraprism telephoto camera. There's an extreme version of it with metasurface lens on top of a wafer (0.5 mm thick), making the total system 0.7 mm thick.
However, its FOV is 10 deg, works at a single wavelength, and the entrance aperture is 0.7 mm.
