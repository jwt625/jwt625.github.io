# Bioresorbable optoelectronic pacemaker 

A grain of rice size pacemaker that is fully bioresorbable... (mostly made with Mg, Mo, and Si)
It even got a phototransistor for wireless optoelectronic control.

   - There is a separate system outside on the skip to go with them.
   - Its battery supplier PowerStream has a lovely website with "add to cart" buttons next every in-stock items

   - there is a video, looks pretty sick: [Digital Mechanical Metamaterials](https://youtube.com/watch?v=A0lJUzcKDsY)
   - probably printed the channel too tight, takes quite some force & can't really cascade because of the force would accumulate too fast & would not continue triggering without me pushing on the whole chain

I don't like "twistronics" but this twisted photonic crystal is pretty crazy

imagine bonding two chips with a sub um gap around the ~ 1 mm central area, and rotate one of them against the other one

# Charge-stabilized droplet does not splash

if you don't want droplets to splash when hitting a surface, charge them up
   - video from: [Charged Droplets Can Hit a Surface Without Splashing](https://physics.aps.org/articles/v18/74)
   - it's because the lamella gets attracted to the surface from electrostatic force.

powering LEDs with water droplets, not from the kinetic energy but from charge transfer 

(they are using 400 LEDs because the optimal load resistance is ~ 1 MΩ, and peak power density is actually as high as 50 W/m^2, and efficiency of 2.2%, kind of crazy)

# Real-time drift correction in microscopy 

example open source status in many fields ([video](https://x.com/jwt0625/status/1909992902190907804)):

- code is in MATLAB, and requires the parallel computing toolbox (??)

still very useful tho, this one is a real-time 3D drift correction for super-resolution microscopy.

I had this random thought: why can't I curl or wget some material properties.

Turns out you almost can. This one is quite nice, and got built-in API. If you are confused about Brillouin Zone etc, it even got interactive plots to help you get even more confused.

it's just not as comprehensive or fit your need as much, but you could contribute to the properties.
