# Designing for Century-Scale Accelerators  

Imagine the thing you are designing won't be in use until 60 years later

# Air-Gap Qubit with Niobium Bridges  

they are so confident in their niobium air bridges process, that they actually made a transmon qubit with a vacuum gap capacitor with it, and it's indeed really good.

# Neural Network-Based Photonics Design 

You are using Synopsys OptSim/Ansys Lumerical INTERCONNECT/Luceda IPKISS/GDSFactory+ for your photonics circuit simulation, I'm using pytorch, we are not the same.

(this is probably a dumb idea but hey it got built-in tolerance analysis called backpropagation, and many benchmarking, visualization stuff)


(Will make the coupler modeling more accurate & add more components etc)
![20250329_062557_0.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20250225_20250406/20250329_062557_0.jpg)

   - this should be freaking illegal man, how is getting a tolerance analysis this easy
   ![20250329_063831_0.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20250225_20250406/20250329_063831_0.jpg)
   - now with non-ideal directional coupler
   ![20250329_204207_0.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20250225_20250406/20250329_204207_0.jpg)

   - playing with optimization... This thing is SO EASY to run, here is before and after optimizing for 45:55 splitting for a wide bandwidth.
   - I'm going to do all my future fitting/optimization in pytorch. Everything is a nn for me now.
   - (of course this is purely for fun, it's not easy to shape coupling in frequency domain, but will think about how to do this along direction of propagation which is much more practical)
   ![20250329_233123_0.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20250225_20250406/20250329_233123_0.jpg)

   - optimizing just shifting and scaling of detuning and coupling (more practical than arbitrary detuning and coupling), and doing it over five segments
   - Quite some improvements between before and after.
   ![20250330_071500_0.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20250225_20250406/20250330_071500_0.jpg)

   - implemented a ring resonator and added to one arm of the mzi
   - hopefully will find time tmw to test optimization for the linearity of the mzi slope like in this work
   ![20250330_090623_0.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20250225_20250406/20250330_090623_0.jpg)

   - Got the optimization running, it's tricky and converges to weird local min all the time.
   - Here's a decent one. The ring is so low-Q it's pretty much a bad MZI.
   - Now I think about it, you could always cascade MZIs with harmonic frequency to compose whatever response you want like a

   - now after thinking about this a bit, why not a big slab of vapor cell, and optically control & readout Rydberg atoms?
   - this might get rid of the expensive mmw LNAs, maybe the responsivity does not work out at all. Time to figure out more numbers

# 3D Coil-Based Full-Motion Haptics  

This haptic actuator uses a three-axis tri-coil to push a magnet around on your skin.

They call them full freedom-of-motion actuators, could generate stroking, pinching/stretching, tapping etc., and they showed hand navigation with one such actuator, and virtual texture sensation (shear <-> friction coefficient, vibration frequency <-> spatial frequency of surface roughness etc.)

# Traveling-Wave MEMS Micromotor  

It's kind of funny and counterintuitive that when you move big things with a traveling acoustic/mechanical wave, the direction they move would be the opposite direction of the wave.

(this micromotor is driven by a traveling wave)

(the last gif is a cross-section view, if you follow the displacement arrows near the surface, you can see why things get moved to the opposite direction)

(when things are smaller than the acoustic wavelength it would be different)

# Vapor Cell Diffractive Optical Elements  

you've seen vapor cells before, but how about vapor cells shaped into diffractive optical elements like a Fresnel lens? (so that the diffraction depends on detuning / small freq change)

They used it to generate discriminator signals for frequency stabilization. Sadly efficiency is very low ~1%, otherwise this could be optically/magnetically tunable active DOE?

# Ultra-High-Q Niobium Cavities  

what do you mean a quality factor of 3e10?

what do you mean "the cavity reached a quality factor of 1e10 at 1 MV/m with a very good reproducibility"??

folks quantum computing is solved, we just need big ass cavities.

(there are smaller cavities with almost comparable Q at power level relevant to quantum stuff)

# On-Chip Polarization Control and Beam Shaping  

stuff like this always makes me wonder, do you really win over free-space optics between the hustle of aligning fiber vs optics, and how much spatial density of control dof you lose moving from SLM/DMD to rings and MZIs. Seems to only make sense if you want high-speed.
