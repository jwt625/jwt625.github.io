1. POV your job is to build a 20 MW calorimeter and calibrate it

4. When would we be able to assemble a dataset like this but for lab/fab/shop/factory scenarios? Is it possible? Would all the technical stuff get blurred for confidentiality just like people's faces and license plates etc. for privacy concerns?
Maybe everyone do need to collect their own data and train/finetune their own models.

6. You'll need somewhere between 5 to 50,000 of 12in wafers of superconducting qubits (and connect & operate them properly) to make a cryptanalytically relevant quantum computer (CRQC).

9. What a coincidence, when you make a microwave coax cable superconduct, its propagation loss became very similar to optical fibers, 0.3 dB/km instead of the usual ~0.5 dB/m.
- But wait, the wavelength for light is much shorter, 40,000x shorter. So don't get fooled, fiber is still much much better in propagation length in wavelengths, or quality factor Q.
- If you run the numbers, the Q for a telecom fiber at 1.55 um is 130 billion... If a superconducting qubit has this Q, its T1 would be four seconds instead of few hundred microseconds. A microwave photon would be able to live in the superconducting cable for ~100 us, comparable to the best SC qubits.
- Also the spool of cable takes a whopping one week to thermalize... Maybe they should pot most of it in stycast lol.

   - I was expecting a superconducting rectangular waveguide would be better than the coax, but nope it is comparable.
   - To be fair this is the loaded Q or total Q, including external coupling loss, and looks like it's dominated by external coupling (S21 very close to 1). So intrinsic Q maybe 10x better.
   - Similar propagation loss quoted in their more recent work with a 30 m (?!) waveguide. ([Magnard2020](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.125.260502), [Storz2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05885-0))

11. Surprise! When you dig out an empty core surrounded by strongly scattering media, light is better guided inside the core!
While maybe I should stop being surprised this is in nature physics, it is pretty relevant to bio applications. They even showed a "Monte Carlo simulation of light propagating through the human head", "guided" by the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

14. Laser ranging over 100+ km with ~100 nm precision! (in 21 s, and ~10 um in 1 ms)
- Note it is not 100 nm accuracy because of fluctuations in air, of which they could measure the temperature to what looks like 0.01 K level lol.
- It uses frequency comb, which roughly speaking gives you nm-scale resolution similar to c.w. laser interferometry, and large ambiguity range from the RF frequency repetition rate, and can be further extended with multiple/tunable repetition rate.
- What is it for? Definitely too fancy for daily activities. It is for e.g. a 100 km synthetic aperture X-ray telescope, which needs nanoscale precision of the baseline distance, or measure "spatial structures and finally the temporal changes of the Earth's gravitational field", because it would change the satellite orbit a bit, aka satellite gravimetry.

   - Chen2024: [113 km absolute ranging with nanometer precision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05542)
   - They have to synchronize the clocks and lasers at the two stations to do the two-way version, which saves half of the transmission power loss, and that is a separate work on its own:

   - The previous and "original" dual comb ranging paper has better explanation of how this approach works to get both high precision and large ambiguity range.
   - Their fig. 1 shows the idea nicely in time domain. Basically, the dual optical frequency comb beats against each other and downconverts to an RF frequency comb (beat of the red and blue optical pulse in dashed box in b gives you one point on your photodetector signal trace). This transfers the relative phase info between the two optical combs (for range resolution) to the phase in the rf signal.

   - I figure I should also include some background on optical frequency comb and dual comb.
   - Optical frequency comb is very nice for metrology since it links the optical and RF frequency domains. Dual comb got the extra benefits of heterodyne detection, plus no need for ultrafast detections.
   - Here are two nice reviews that are also more recent and open access.

15. Erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs) are so important for telecom, one of its patent earns second largest source of royalties for Stanford, only behind Google's.
- Two years ago, an on-chip version came out with both gain and max power comparable to COTS EDFAs.
- Now they've doped it even harder, and showed actual 170 GBaud * 64 QAM (~6 bit) * 16 WDM * 2 PDM ~ 25.6 Tb/s operation using it as a booster amplifier. This means its noise figure and nonlinearities are also on par with EDFAs.
- Funny the waveguide gets doped and annealed so hard it no longer looks like a rectangle lol.
- QAM: quadrature amplitude modulation, WDM: wavelength division multiplexing, PDM: polarization-division multiplexing

   - Look how the waveguide has deformed before and after doping + annealing (Fig. S1b and S1c). This is with less doping than the newer one.

   - The royalties claim is from [the Digonnet group](https://digonnetgroup.sites.stanford.edu)
   - Maybe it is only looking at after 1990s. Here is another source that has it in the top six from 1975 to 2005:
