# Quantum Sensing: NV Centers in Compact Magnetometers

Been telling people quantum sensing is already here.

It's in LIGO, in CSAC, and this is a magnetometer based on diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center, with laser diode, microwave antenna, filter, and photodiode all together in a < 3 cc hermetically sealed package, <10 nT per rtHz.

# High-Tc Superconducting SQUIDs Under Extreme Pressure

TIL people make SQUIDs with high Tc superconductors, and even under pressure, such as this one that works at ~180 K and under ~150 GPa.
Never seen a SQUID "array" this cursed, because instead of well defined Josephson junctions, you get random weak links..

# Pulsed Power Plasma Experiments with MA Current

This little thing has 1 MA of current running thru the wires for few hundred ns to generate plasma (ofc driven by Marx generators).
They have at least one bird lover on the team, this one's generator is called MAGPIE, and there is a new one called PUFFIN.

# Precision Engineering in Optical Systems (Narrow Linewidth ECDLs and MOPA Systems)

I missed so many details: look at the flexures near the mounting screws, with all the corners properly rounded. The dimples and glass beads (?) for alignment.

How many temperature sensors can you find? How about photodiodes and amplifiers?
![20250304_044722_0.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20241206_20250308/20250304_044722_0.jpg)

# Shadow Masking in Lithium Niobate Fabrication

Cowboy nanofab:

In order to get a wider and smoother thickness transition, these people made a big "shadow mask" hovering 1 mm above the chip to spread out the plasma, and got a 180 um wide transition zone.

They used it to make spot size converters on lithium niobate-on-insulator (LNOI) photonic circuits.

# Superconducting Qubit on Sapphire Discharge failure

This superconducting qubit is next to super long "antennas", almost one cm, and they found that it could exploded from electric discharge during resist spinning or chip dicing 

(one aspect that sapphire "sucks", it's too good of an insulator.)

   - Why not a protecting diode? The annoying thing is these microwave circuits and resonators (qubit is basically a very nonlinear resonator) are very low loss, Q > 1 M, so adding anything could potentially spoil the high Q.

# High-Temperature Piezoelectric AlScN Testing


A probe station that is glowing hot at 1000 C 

(Testing that aluminum scandium nitride works up to 1000 C. It's so hot they have to use tantalum silicide as electrodes. They also found the piezoelectricity of AlScN increased almost 10x, but probably only at low freq.)

# High-Resolution Thermoreflectance Imaging


Not happy with the speed or resolution of your IR thermal camera? Take a look at thermoreflectance techniques/imaging, which is more oriented to device/chip/package level.

It offers much higher spatial (< 1 um) and temporal (<1 us) resolution, because you are using a shorter wavelength to probe the change in reflectivity due to the change of temperature.

# Miniaturized Microwave Switches with Phase Change Materials


One of the smallest microwave switch I've ever seen, only 500 um across! (and it's mostly for contact pads. Background is finger skin)

It's based on germanium telluride thermal phase change material, switching speed ~< 1 us, IL < -0.5 dB up to 67 GHz, and isolation > 20 dB up to 30 GHz, power handling up to ~ 5 W.
