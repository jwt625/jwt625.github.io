Dumping some of the photos I took during open sauce 2025 (July 19 ~ 20) with short explanations and descriptions.


# Day 1: July 19, 2025

There was a huge line to enter the parking lot (there are only three toll gates), so I parked at the Fiesta Meadows Park nearby, and walked along the Borel Creek to the venue. The whole area on the east side of the Borel Cree cannot reach Saratoga Dr. What a legendary US urban planning.

- Saw this in the left side room next to the main hall, vintage electronics recovery.

- professional film camera from [backhaul studios](https://www.backhaul.us/studios), with a motorized remote control for focus. The focus is also indicated with in-focus edges highlighted with red color. The visual effect is really cool when you scan the focus thru the scene
- they also brought a few movie/show props, and stories about a smoke grenade prop that has to roll to a given location and detonate at given timing
- people look for story telling more than technical (mechanical/electrical engineering) skills

![OpenSauce2025 Image 7](/assets/images/2025/OpenSauce2025/IMG_0390.jpeg)
- the gaming setup with yaw-pitch-roll control from oshcut, and leaderboard with creators (the line was too long so they only let creators play with it)



![OpenSauce2025 Image 8](/assets/images/2025/OpenSauce2025/IMG_0393.JPG)
- end of day 1, internet was so bad that I put my meshtastic together
- Had to flash new open sauce specific firmware, as well as download the new app the next day
- this was how it looked like before

# Thoughts

I should get some transcripts going next time as I walk around. Too many interesting things and talks and I cannot remember everything.

How does the streamers have internet??

There are more videos that this website cannot hold on its own. Maybe a youtube playlist?

A lot of the talks were not as interesting, quite some are off topic, and some are cringe. The reverse engineering one was fun. A lot of old generation youtubers hate AI.
