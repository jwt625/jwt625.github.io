# Ion Trap Packaging

lol look at this elevated highway but it's actually the ground. The ground is in the air.

# Optical Microparticle Acceleration in Hollow-Core Fiber 

There are crazy accelerators for fundamental physics, and then there are also accelerators for practical engineering, such as surface pitting of hypersonic vehicles.

This work proposed and demonstrated acceleration of 5 um diameter particles to few cm/s using a ~100 mW laser and 1 m of hollow-core fiber.

The system they built could reach 100 m/s with minor modification like better vacuum, and a scaled up system with 1 kW laser power and ~ 10 m fiber should do 10 km/s and beyond.

# Triboelectric Nanogenerator-Based Haptic Glove  

A self-powered electrotactile textile haptic glove.

Top electrode is embroidered with conductive silver fiber, on a commercial FEP film layer, and then on the bottom conductive silver fiber on the fabric, forming a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG).

Signal and energy from it is used for sensing, powering, as well as to trigger a little gas discharge tube for tactile feedback.

   - The TENG is capable of generating ~600 V and ~20 nC of charge.
   - Funny it's roughly 30 dB between sensation of the discharge, and feeling uncomfortable.

# Quantum Chips as Accidental Artifacts  

folks at Google/IBM/AWS quantum could probably make a side hustle selling defected chips as quantum sigils.

# Cryogenic TWPA Assembly and Shielding  

Post something that's a flex to a niche group, that most folks won't understand.
![20250324_143137_0.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20240804_20250330/20250324_143137_0.jpg)

   - yeah a cryogenic microwave amplifier. input referred noise about two microwave photons
   - the flex coax cables home made, has to be about the right length. the whole assembly goes into shielding cans and theres not much room to spare. I actually had to file the edge of a 90 deg connector a bit to make it fit

# On-Chip Programmable Optical Nonlinearity  

Programmable optical nonlinearity on a chip? Sounds too good.

It is using a patterned illumination onto a photoconductor layer to "turn on and off" a bias field, which lowers chi3 nonlinearity to chi2. They could shape it in both spatial and spectral domain.

The catch? The waveguide is a bit lossy (1~5 dB/cm), the programming is slow (~ 1 Hz, limited by SLM), and the nonlinearity is weak: ~0.5 pm/V, but potentially > 20 pm/V in the future. For comparison, lithium niobate has d33 ~ 25 pm/V.

   - the fast SLMs could go above 1 kHz, by then it would be limited by the device RC time to be ~200 Hz. Maybe they just have a cheaper and slower one
   
   

# Drone-Based OAM Quantum Key Distribution  

When you see people calling their beam a flying donut, you know it's only a matter of time when you see people receiving the beam calling it "donut-biting".

(the paper is basically saying: if you could bite the whole donut, you should aim to bite the whole donut. But if you cannot bite the whole donut, you better aim to bite onto the actual donut)

# 3D-Printed Hollow-Core Polymer Fibers  

This classic picture of hollow core fiber got me thinking: has anyone 3d printed and pulled plastic HCF? Should be much easier to pull.

Of course the answer is yes: preform FDM printed with translucent Z-Glass filament, drawn at 158 C and 2 m/min at tension ~120g, propagation loss ~0.1 dB/cm, two orders of magnitude smaller than the material absorption loss.

   - heck you could even do mid IR with PETG, similar propagation loss of ~0.3 dB/cm at 4.5 um, two orders of magnitude smaller than the material propagation loss (>100 dB/cm)

# Visible Spectrum from Infrared Frequency Comb  

is this the first paper that has all the colors in the title?

The next one I could quickly find only has four colors

# Complex-Frequency Excitations in Wave Physics  

It's cool to figure out optimal pulse shapes for different systems and purposes, but the name complex-frequency excitation triggers me..

Why don't we call a gaussian pulse a non-markovian excitation, and the pump-probe scheme the retarded scheme

- [Tiny Tapeout](https://github.com/jwt625/tt-test)
   - abort? (because of efabless no funding)
