1. [SmartBolts](https://smartbolts.com/) makes fasteners with built-in visual indicators for monitoring preload.
- Their youtube channel has a [demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZy7CbpQAvY&ab_channel=SmartBolts).
- It seems to be based on thickness change of a light absorbing fluid ([patent](https://portal.unifiedpatents.com/patents/patent/US-4904132-A)).

2. [halfbakery](https://www.halfbakery.com/) is a website collecting random half baked ideas.
- I found it when trying to see if ultrasonic ice cream scoop exists: [Vibroscoop](https://www.halfbakery.com/idea/Vibroscoop)

3. [Langmuir systems](https://www.langmuirsystems.com/) is making cheaper manifacturing tools.
- They have a sub $5000 [CNC press brake](https://www.langmuirsystems.com/titan25t).

4. Some cheap GPS modules are cheaper than$10 bucks now. However a lot of people were saying this specific one is old and not reliable.

5. You can now generate CAD from text description. Works for common needs, still not able to generate niche stuff like a mmw horn antenna.

7. Trump survived an assasination attempt. This is non-tech but such an outside-five-sigma event (or actually kind of expected) so here it is.

8. Sodium-potassium amalgam could dissolve fluorocarbon polymers after plasma etch.
- From paper [Improved Coherence in Optically-Defned Niobium Trilayer Junction Qubits](https://lss.fnal.gov/archive/2023/pub/fermilab-pub-23-330-etd.pdf)

9. [smoltex](https://pypi.org/project/smoltex/) is a handy natural language to latex tool.

10. Researchers at Cornell made laser actuated um-scale robots that are safe to transfer with pippette (old news from 2020).
- Paper: [Electronically integrated, mass-manufactured, microscopic robots](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2626-9)
