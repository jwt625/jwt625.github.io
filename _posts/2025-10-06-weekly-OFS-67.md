   - it's a 2x2 optical switch, so you could see four fibers, and a MEMS comb drive that stick a mirror in and out between them, to change the config between bar and cross

# Lithium Niobate Mode/Wavelength Multiplexer

this multimode waveguide grating (MWG) and the way this whole mux/demux works are going to be a great photonics interview question

# Phased Array Grating Lobe Suppression

shifting the position or phase of a phased array a bit to kill grating lobes

(power is still there, just not as concentrated)

what do you mean for a range of frequencies?

# Integrated Optical Parametric Amplification

see, this is how you do a radar plot. Have some confidence.

   - it still hurts my brain thinking about this conversion efficiency.. can it actually be 100%?
energy conservation is fine, but what about entropy, you are getting fewer photons out?

# PDMS Pillar Cell Separation Force Measurement

guess how much force do you need to separate two cells?

( they tried to measure it with deformation of little PDMS pillars )

   - which has quite some intro info on AlScN, a good material that is getting more and more popular
( good piezo, cmos compatible, and there's also some high temp FET made with it iirc )
   ![20251001_072326_0.jpg](/assets/images/2025/20240920_20251005/20251001_072326_0.jpg)

   - for some of them yes, esp electrostatic ones.
piezo ones i think there are bulkier ones with buy button, but crazy expensive and used for AMO people
   - these have tue mirror exposed.
some other ones have fusion bonded cover.

   <!-- - make some optics friends and hang out with them
   - yeah e.g. to image different fluorescent species separately and then combine them
   - real photo according to the figure caption. -->
<!-- maybe they have a good camera a dark room and long exposure -->
   <!-- - hmm any example specs, do they have similar flatness, insertion loss etc? -->
   <!-- - just like usual imaging, plus using the dichroic mirrors to cut up the spectrum into separate wavelengths onto separate cameras -->
   <!-- - this sounds familiar! -->
<!-- some of my AMO friends probably are doing this as well (dual image projection) -->
   <!-- - very roughly few percent per component -->

<!-- sad it probably wont work up to GHz where im mostly interested in -->
   <!-- - yeah it's a polymer, you can form it in sooo many different ways. -->
<!-- spin coating it at hot temperature really is refreshing for me to see. -->

      - should really continue one-click-paper-page!
   - week 63:
      - Continuing [one click web paper](https://github.com/jwt625/PlayGround/tree/main/20250831_one_click_paper_page). Got actual deployment working. Had to refactor backend etc.
      - Also added traffic speed to [Bay Bridge traffic](https://bay-bridge-traffic.com). The repo was spun off from PlayGround last weekend iirc.
      ![BBT-speed](/assets/images/2025/BBT-speed.png)

      - https://bay-bridge-traffic.com
      - I think it is already getting hit hard and slowing down the detection, might have to take this down
      - nope not really getting hit hard, not sure what it was, added some rate limiting and restarted things, now back to 30 fps most of the time
